## Cost Comparison

Contoso Electronics deducts the employee's portion of the healthcare cost from each paycheck. This
means that the cost of the health insurance will be spread out over the course of the year, rather
than being paid in one lump sum. The employee's portion of the cost will be calculated based on the
selected health plan and the number of people covered by the insurance. The table below shows a
cost comparison between the different health plans offered by Contoso Electronics:
