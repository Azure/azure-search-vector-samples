## Summary of Benefits


### Northwind Standard

Northwind Standard is a basic plan that provides coverage for medical, vision, and dental
services. This plan also offers coverage for preventive care services, as well as prescription
drug coverage. With Northwind Standard, you can choose from a variety of in-network
providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This
plan does not offer coverage for emergency services, mental health and substance abuse
coverage, or out-of-network services.


### SUMMARY OF YOUR COSTS


#### Summary of Your Costs

When you choose Northwind Standard as your health plan, you can rest assured that you
are getting comprehensive coverage at an affordable cost. Here, we will explain the various
costs associated with this plan so that you know what to expect when it comes to your out-
of-pocket expenses.


#### Premiums

Premiums are the amount of money that you will need to pay each month for your coverage.
Northwind Standard requires that premiums be paid on a monthly basis in order to keep
the coverage in force. These premiums are based on the age and health of the policy holder,
as well as the type of coverage that is chosen.


#### Deductibles

A deductible is the amount of money that you will need to pay out of pocket before your
insurance plan will begin to cover the costs of your medical services. The deductible for
Northwind Standard is $2,000 per person, per year. This means that you will need to pay
the first $2,000 of your medical expenses before the plan will begin to cover the remaining
amount.


#### Co-payments and Co-insurance

Once you have met your deductible, you will be responsible for co-payments and co-
insurance. Co-payments are a fixed amount that you will need to pay at the time of service,
while co-insurance is a percentage that you will need to pay. For Northwind Standard, the
co-payment is $30 for primary care visits and $50 for specialist visits. The co-insurance is
20% of the remaining cost after the deductible has been met.


#### Out-of-Pocket Maximum

The out-of-pocket maximum for Northwind Standard is $6,000 per person, per year. This is
the maximum amount that you will need to pay for your medical expenses in a given year.

<!-- PageBreak -->

Once you have reached this limit, the plan will cover 100% of your expenses for the
remainder of the year.


### Tips for Managing Your Costs

There are several steps that you can take to help manage your costs when you are enrolled
in Northwind Standard. Here are a few tips that you can use to get the most out of your
coverage:

· Make sure to take advantage of preventive care services. These services are covered 100%
by the plan and can help you avoid more costly treatments down the line.

· Always make sure to visit in-network providers. Doing so will ensure that you receive the
maximum benefit from your plan.

· Consider generic prescription drugs when available. These drugs can often be cheaper
than brand-name drugs and are just as effective.

. Talk to your doctor about ways to save money. Many doctors are willing to work with you
to find the most cost-effective treatment options available.

· Review your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) statements carefully. This document will show
you exactly how much you are being charged for each service and what your plan is
covering.

By following these tips, you can ensure that you are getting the most out of your Northwind
Standard health plan.


## HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS


### In-Network Providers HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS

When selecting a health insurance plan, one of the most important factors to consider is the
network of in-network providers that are available with the plan.

Northwind Standard offers a wide variety of in-network providers, ranging from primary
care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This allows you to choose a provider
that is convenient for you and your family, while also helping you to keep your costs low.

When you choose a provider that is in-network with your plan, you will typically pay lower
copays and deductibles than you would with an out-of-network provider. In addition, many
services, such as preventive care, may be covered at no cost when you receive care from an
in-network provider.

It is important to note, however, that Northwind Standard does not offer coverage for
emergency services, mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-network

<!-- PageBreak -->

services. This means that you may have to pay out of pocket for these services if you receive
them from an out-of-network provider.

When choosing an in-network provider, there are a few tips to keep in mind. First, make
sure that the provider you choose is in-network with your plan. You can confirm this by
calling the provider's office and asking them if they are in-network with Northwind
Standard. You can also use the provider search tool on the Northwind Health website to
make sure your provider is in-network.

Second, make sure that the provider you choose is accepting new patients. Some providers
may be in-network but not be taking new patients.

Third, consider the location of the provider. If the provider is too far away, it may be
difficult for you to get to your appointments.

Finally, consider the provider's office hours. If you work during the day, you may need to
find a provider that has evening or weekend hours.

Choosing an in-network provider can help you save money on your health care costs. By
following the tips above and researching your options, you can find a provider that is
convenient, affordable, and in-network with your Northwind Standard plan.

Continuity of Care

HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: CONTINUITY OF CARE

At Contoso, we understand the importance of providing our employees with access to a
quality, affordable health care plan. We are proud to offer our employees Northwind
Standard, an insurance plan that provides coverage for medical, vision, and dental services.
We also offer continuity of care, which is the ability to stay with the same provider for all
your health care needs, from routine checkups to specialized care.

Continuity of care is an important component of any health care plan, as it allows you to
develop a relationship with your doctor, who is more likely to recognize any changes in
your health and be able to provide better, more personalized care. With Northwind
Standard, you can stay with the same provider throughout your health care journey, helping
you to receive the best possible care.

Continuity of care also helps you save money on health care costs. When you stay with the
same provider, you are likely to pay less than if you switch around from provider to
provider. This is because your provider already has all your medical records, and you won't
need to pay for expensive tests and procedures that you've already had done.

There are a few exceptions to the continuity of care. If you move to a different area, you may
need to find a new provider. Additionally, if you are in need of specialized care, such as
surgery or a complex treatment, you may need to visit a specialist who does not accept your
insurance plan. In these cases, you should be sure to check with your insurance company
and/or provider to make sure you understand any associated costs.

<!-- PageBreak -->

There are a few tips you can follow to ensure you are taking full advantage of continuity of
care and are getting the best, most affordable care possible. First, be sure to always keep
your provider information up to date. If you move or change providers, be sure to notify
your insurance company right away. Additionally, if you are in need of specialized care, be
sure to check with your provider to understand any associated costs. Finally, if you are
switching providers or insurance plans, make sure you get copies of your medical records
from your previous provider.

At Contoso, we strive to provide our employees with access to quality, affordable health
care. We are proud to offer Northwind Standard, an insurance plan that provides continuity
of care, helping you to receive the best possible care and save money on health care costs.


#### Non-Participating

Non-Participating Providers and How They Affect Your Costs

When selecting a health care provider, it is important to understand the differences
between participating and non-participating providers. Participating providers are those
who have agreed to accept the Northwind Standard health plan's set rates. Non-
participating providers are those who have not agreed to accept the set rates and can
charge the patient more than what the health plan pays.

When you choose a non-participating provider for your healthcare services, you may be
responsible for paying the difference between the provider's actual charges and the amount
the plan pays. This difference is known as the balance billing amount. Depending on your
provider's policy, you may be required to pay the balance billing amount up front. Be sure to
discuss this with your provider prior to receiving services.

Additionally, it is important to note that if you use a non-participating provider, your out-of-
pocket costs may be higher than if you had used a participating provider. For example, if
your provider's charge is $200 and the plan pays $100, you would be responsible for the
remaining $100 balance billing amount.


### Exceptions

There are certain exceptions to the rule of non-participating providers. Your health plan
may cover emergency services provided by non-participating providers, as well as certain
services provided by non-participating providers that are not available from participating
providers. Additionally, in some cases, the health plan may cover non-participating
providers' charges if there are no participating providers in your area.


### Tips

In order to avoid costly balance billing amounts, it is important to make sure that your
provider is a participating provider in your Northwind Standard health plan. If you are
unsure, you can contact the customer service department of your health plan to verify.

<!-- PageBreak -->

It is also important to ask your provider about their policy on balance billing. Be sure to find
out if the provider requires you to pay the balance billing amount up front, or if they will bill
you after the health plan pays them.

When selecting a provider, also remember to consider the cost of services. Participating
providers are often more cost effective than non-participating providers. Additionally, some
providers offer discounts to patients who pay out of pocket for services.

Finally, if you need to use a non-participating provider for certain services, be sure to check
with your health plan first. There may be an exception that will cover the cost of the service.
Additionally, if you need to use a non-participating provider and you are concerned about
the cost, you can always negotiate with your provider to find a more affordable rate.

Balance Billing Protection

HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS - Balance Billing Protection

At Contoso, we understand that medical costs can be intimidating and confusing, which is
why we've partnered with Northwind Health to offer our employees the Northwind
Standard plan. This plan provides a balance billing protection, meaning that you are
protected from unexpected costs when visiting in-network providers.

What is balance billing?

Balance billing is when a provider bills you for the difference between what they charge and
what your insurance company is willing to pay. This difference can be hundreds of dollars
and is often unexpected. With the Northwind Standard plan, you are protected from balance
billing when visiting in-network providers.

What is an in-network provider?

In-network providers are healthcare providers, such as doctors, hospitals, and labs, that
have agreed to accept the Northwind Standard plan's payment terms. Visiting an in-network
provider means that you are protected from balance billing. You can find a list of in-network
providers on the Northwind Health website.

What if I visit an out-of-network provider?

Visiting an out-of-network provider means that you are not protected from balance billing.
Out-of-network providers may charge more for the same services than in-network
providers, and you may be responsible for the difference between what they charge and
what your insurance company is willing to pay. It is important to check if a provider is in-
network before visiting them to avoid any unexpected costs.

Tips to avoid balance billing:

· Always check if a provider is in-network before scheduling an appointment.

<!-- PageBreak -->

· Ask your provider if they accept the Northwind Standard plan before you receive any
services.

· Double-check that the providers you visit are in-network.

· Ask for an estimate of your out-of-pocket costs ahead of time.

. If you receive a bill for more than expected, contact your provider and the insurance
company to negotiate a lower cost.

Exceptions to the balance billing protection:

· Balance billing protection does not apply to emergency services.

· Balance billing protection does not apply to mental health and substance abuse coverage.

· Balance billing protection does not apply to out-of-network providers.

· Balance billing protection is not applicable to any non-covered services.

At Contoso, we want to make sure our employees are provided with the best coverage
options. That's why we've partnered with Northwind Health to offer the Northwind
Standard plan, which provides balance billing protection when visiting in-network
providers. We encourage our employees to use the tips provided to help reduce the risk of
unexpected costs when visiting a provider.


#### Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted Providers

HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted
Providers

One of the important considerations when choosing a health insurance plan is
understanding the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers. When
you receive health care from an in-network provider, your insurance plan will generally
cover a greater portion of your expenses. However, when you receive health care from an
out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay a greater portion of the costs.

Under Northwind Standard, you may receive care from out-of-network providers, but you
will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure you are getting the best
value for your health care expenses, it is important to understand the differences between
in-network and out-of-network providers and how they affect your costs.

In-Network: In-network providers are those who have contracted with Northwind Health to
provide services at a discounted rate. In-network providers have agreed to accept the
amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you pay the portion of the
cost that is not covered by the insurance plan. In-network providers may also offer
additional services or discounts that are not available to out-of-network providers.

<!-- PageBreak -->

Out-of-Network: Out-of-network providers are those who have not contracted with
Northwind Health. As a result, they are not required to accept the amount of payment
offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you may be responsible for a greater portion of
the cost. Additionally, out-of-network providers may not offer additional services or
discounts that are available to in-network providers.

When choosing a provider, it is important to make sure that the provider is in-network.
While it is possible to receive care from out-of-network providers, it is important to
understand that you will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure that
you are getting the best value for your health care expenses, it is recommended that you
choose an in-network provider whenever possible.

There are some exceptions when it comes to receiving care from out-of-network providers.
If you are unable to find an in-network provider in your area or if you require a specific type
of care that is not available from an in-network provider, you may receive care from an out-
of-network provider. In these cases, the cost of care may be more expensive and you may be
responsible for a greater portion of the costs.

In addition to understanding the differences between in-network and out-of-network
providers, it is important to understand the cost sharing associated with each. Northwind
Standard does not cover the full cost of care for out-of-network providers, so you may be
responsible for a greater portion of the costs.

When choosing a provider, it is important to take into account the cost sharing associated
with each provider. If you are unable to find an in-network provider in your area or if you
require a specific type of care that is not available from an in-network provider, it is
important to understand that you may be responsible for a greater portion of the costs.

Finally, it is important to be aware of any additional fees that may be associated with
receiving care from an out-of-network provider. Some providers may charge additional fees
for services that are not covered by Northwind Standard. It is important to ask about any
additional fees before receiving care from an out-of-network provider to make sure you are
aware of any additional costs you may be responsible for.

By understanding the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers, as
well as the cost sharing associated with each, you can make sure that you are getting the
best value for your health care expenses. While it is possible to receive care from an out-of-
network provider, it is important to understand that you may be responsible for a greater
portion of the costs. When choosing a provider, it is important to consider the cost sharing
associated with each provider and to ask about any additional fees before receiving care.


## HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS

When it comes to health insurance, many people are unaware of the different factors that
impact the costs they pay. One of the most significant components that affects your costs is
the provider you choose. Northwind Standard provides coverage for a variety of in-network

<!-- PageBreak -->

providers, and the costs associated with each provider can vary significantly. To ensure
you're getting the best value for your health care services, it's important to understand how
providers can affect your costs.


### In-Network Providers

Choosing in-network providers is the most cost-effective option when it comes to your
Northwind Standard plan. In-network providers have agreed to accept a discounted rate on
services, which means they are often less expensive than out-of-network providers. When
selecting an in-network provider, you will likely only have to pay a portion of the cost for
services, often referred to as a \"co-pay\" or \"co-insurance\". It's important to note that
different types of services may require different co-pays or co-insurance, so it's best to
contact your provider to understand what the cost will be.


### Out-of-Network Providers

Northwind Standard offers coverage for some out-of-network providers, but the costs
associated with these providers can be significantly more expensive than in-network
providers. If you choose an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for the entire
cost of services, or a far greater portion of the cost than you would with an in-network
provider. In some cases, Northwind Standard may offer coverage for out-of-network
providers, but you may still have to pay more than you would for an in-network provider.


#### Exceptions

Some providers may offer services that are outside of the Northwind Standard plan
coverage. Depending on the services provided, you may have to pay out-of-pocket for
services that are not covered. Additionally, it's important to note that there may be different
rules and coverage levels associated with certain types of services, such as those related to
mental health and substance abuse.


### Tips

If you're considering a provider that is not in-network, it's important to understand the
costs associated with that provider before you book an appointment. Contacting the
provider directly to ask about their rates, as well as any special arrangements they offer for
Northwind Standard members, can help you get a better idea of what you'll be paying for
services. Additionally, it's important to check with Northwind Health to make sure the
provider is covered by the Northwind Standard plan and what types of services are covered.

When selecting a provider, it's also important to consider the quality of care they provide.
You should look for providers that offer high-quality care that meets your specific needs.
Additionally, Northwind Health offers a variety of resources to help you find the right
provider, such as a provider search tool and a provider directory.

Choosing the right provider is important when it comes to your Northwind Standard plan.
By understanding how providers can affect your costs, you can make sure you're getting the

<!-- PageBreak -->

best value for your health care services. By using Northwind Health's resources and
researching providers in advance, you can make sure you're getting the care you need at the
best cost.


## IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION


### Copayments (Copays)


### IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Copayments (Copays)

At Northwind Health, our Northwind Standard plan includes copayments (copays) for
certain services. A copayment is a fixed amount that you pay at the time of service, and it is
generally a lower amount than what you would have to pay if you were to pay the full cost
of the service.

Copays for Northwind Standard vary depending on the type of service you receive.
Generally speaking, copays for office visits are typically less than copays for hospital visits.
For example, copays for office visits with a primary care physician may be $20, while copays
for a hospital visit may be up to $150. It is important to note that the copays may vary from
provider to provider and from state to state.

In addition to office visits, copays may also apply to other services, such as prescriptions
and diagnostic testing. For example, copays for generic prescription drugs may be $10,
while copays for brand-name drugs may be $35. Copays for diagnostic testing, such as lab
tests and X-rays, may range from $20 to $100 depending on the type of test.

It is important to note that Northwind Standard does not cover certain services, such as
emergency services and mental health and substance abuse services. For these services, you
may be responsible for the full cost of the service, so it is important to understand your plan
and read the fine print before receiving any services.

In addition to copays, you may also be charged coinsurance for certain services.
Coinsurance is a percentage of the cost of the service that you are responsible for paying.
Generally speaking, coinsurance rates are lower than copays, so it is important to
understand the difference between the two.

Finally, there are some exceptions to the copayment rules. For example, preventive care
services may be covered at no cost to you. This includes routine physical exams,
immunizations, and screenings for certain diseases such as cancer and diabetes.

Overall, copays are a great way to save money on health care services. Understanding your
plan and reading the fine print can help you to save money on health care services. It is also
important to remember that copays may vary from provider to provider and from state to
state, so it is important to do your research before receiving any services.

Split Copay For Office Visits
IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Split Copay For Office Visits

<!-- PageBreak -->

At Northwind Health, we understand how important it is to have access to quality,
affordable healthcare. That's why we provide our members with Split Copay for Office Visits
under the Northwind Standard plan. With this benefit, you can expect to pay a set
copayment for office visits, regardless of the provider you visit.

What is Split Copay for Office Visits?

Split Copay for Office Visits is a feature of the Northwind Standard plan that allows you to
pay a set copayment for most office visits. This copayment covers both the provider and the
facility charges for office visits. The amount of the copayment will depend on the type of
provider you visit, such as a primary care physician or specialist.

Who is eligible for Split Copay for Office Visits?

All members of the Northwind Standard plan are eligible for Split Copay for Office Visits.
This benefit is available to all members, regardless of where they live or work.

Are there any exceptions?

Yes, there are some exceptions to the Split Copay for Office Visits benefit. This benefit does
not apply to hospital or emergency room visits, mental health and substance abuse services,
or out-of-network services.

Are there any tips I should know about?

Yes, here are a few tips to help you make the most of the Split Copay for Office Visits benefit:

· Before scheduling an appointment, make sure the provider you are visiting is in-network.
You can check your plan's directory of providers for more information.

· Many providers are now offering virtual visits, which can be a great way to access care
without having to leave the comfort of your home.

. Make sure to bring your insurance card to every appointment. That way, you can make
sure that your copayment is applied correctly.

. If you have any questions about the cost of your office visit, don't hesitate to ask your
provider's office. They should be able to tell you exactly how much you can expect to pay for
the visit.

At Northwind Health, we are committed to providing our members with access to quality,
affordable healthcare. We hope that the Split Copay for Office Visits benefit will make it
easier for you to get the care you need.

Calendar Year Deductible

IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Calendar Year Deductible

<!-- PageBreak -->

The Northwind Standard plan has a calendar year deductible of $2,000 for each individual
and $4,000 for each family. A calendar year deductible is the amount you must pay for
health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. The deductible applies to most
services received from in-network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists,
hospitals, and pharmacies.

However, there are some exceptions. For example, preventive care services, such as
immunizations and annual physicals, are covered at 100% with no deductible. Additionally,
prescription drugs are subject to a separate prescription drug deductible of $250 per
individual and $500 per family.

It is important to note that this deductible does not roll over into the next year. This means
that you must meet the deductible amount in the current year before your insurance begins
to pay. Additionally, the deductible may not apply to all services. For example, you may not
be subject to the deductible when you receive in-network emergency services.

Tips for Meeting the Calendar Year Deductible

Meeting your calendar year deductible may seem like a daunting task, but there are a few
steps you can take to help ensure that you reach it.

First, take advantage of any preventive care services that are covered at 100%. These
services are important for your health, and you can use them to help meet your deductible
without paying out of pocket.

Second, use caution when selecting providers. The Northwind Standard plan has a large
network of in-network providers, and using these providers will help ensure that you are
not paying more than you have to for services.

Third, consider using a health savings account (HSA). An HSA is a tax-advantaged savings
account that can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. Contributions to an HSA are
tax-deductible and the funds can be used to help pay for deductibles and other medical
costs.

Finally, take advantage of any discount programs that may be available. Many providers
offer discounts for cash payments on services, and these can help reduce the amount of
money you need to pay out of pocket.

By following these tips, you can make sure that you reach your deductible and take
advantage of the full benefits of the Northwind Standard plan.


#### Coinsurance

IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance

Coinsurance is a type of cost sharing that you are responsible for after meeting your
deductible. Coinsurance is often a percentage of the cost of the service you receive. For

<!-- PageBreak -->

example, if the coinsurance is 10%, you will be responsible for paying 10% of the cost of the
service you received, while the insurance company pays the other 90%.

Under Northwind Standard, coinsurance is set at 20% for in-network services, with some
exceptions. For in-network hospital stays, coinsurance is set at 25%. Additionally,
coinsurance for out-of-network services is set at 40%.

It's important to note that coinsurance does not apply to the services that are covered by
the plan's copayment amounts. Copayment is a fixed amount that you are responsible for
paying for certain services and is typically much less than coinsurance. Additionally,
Northwind Standard does not require coinsurance for preventive care services.

When you receive services, it's important to ask about the cost of the service and make sure
you are aware of any coinsurance costs. It's also important to be aware of the coinsurance
rate for out-of-network services and to consider if it's worth the cost to pay more for out-of-
network services.

It's also important to be aware that coinsurance costs are calculated based on the allowed
amount for the service. This means if you receive a service that is more expensive than what
is allowed by the plan, your coinsurance costs will be based on the allowed amount, not the
actual cost.

If you are unable to pay the coinsurance costs for a service up front, Northwind Standard
will allow you to make payments over time. This is a great option for those who need
services but may not be able to pay the entire coinsurance amount in one payment.

Finally, it's important to know that coinsurance costs are applied to your out-of-pocket
maximum. This means that you can use coinsurance costs to help you reach your out-of-
pocket maximum faster, thus reducing the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket
for services.

In summary, coinsurance is a cost sharing requirement under Northwind Standard that is
typically 20% for in-network services and 40% for out-of-network services. It's important
to be aware of the costs associated with coinsurance and to consider if it's worth the cost to
pay more for out-of-network services. Additionally, coinsurance costs count towards your
out-of-pocket maximum and you can make payments over time if needed.

Out-Of-Pocket Maximum

IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Out-of-Pocket Maximum

Employees enrolled in the Northwind Standard plan can benefit from an out-of-pocket
maximum that helps to protect them from large medical bills. This limit applies to certain
covered services and includes deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. The out-of-pocket
maximum for the Northwind Standard plan is $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a
family.

<!-- PageBreak -->

Employees should be aware that certain services may not be subject to the out-of-pocket
maximum. These services include any charges that are not related to the diagnosis and
treatment of an illness or injury. For example, non-covered services like cosmetic surgery,
non-prescription drugs, or services that were provided outside of the Northwind Health
network will not count toward the out-of-pocket maximum.

It's important for employees to remember that the out-of-pocket maximum will reset at the
start of the calendar year. This means that any out-of-pocket expenses paid during the
previous year will not carry over to the new year.

To keep track of their out-of-pocket expenses, employees should review their insurance
statements regularly. They should also review their Explanation of Benefits (EOB)
documents to make sure that all of their expenses have been properly accounted for. This
can help them to stay on top of their out-of-pocket expenses and avoid exceeding the
maximum.

Employees should also be aware that the out-of-pocket maximum does not include the cost
of premiums. The cost of premiums is not counted toward the out-of-pocket maximum and
is in addition to any out-of-pocket expenses that employees incur.

Finally, if employees are thinking of switching to a different health plan, they should be
aware that out-of-pocket costs can vary from plan to plan. Employees should compare the
out-of-pocket maximums and deductibles of different plans before deciding which one is
best for them.

In summary, the Northwind Standard plan offers employees an out-of-pocket maximum of
$6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family. Employees should be aware that certain
services are not subject to this maximum and that their out-of-pocket expenses will reset at
the start of the calendar year. They should also remember that the out-of-pocket maximum
does not include the cost of premiums. Finally, they should compare the out-of-pocket
maximums and deductibles of different plans before deciding which one is best for them.


#### Allowed Amount

IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: ALLOWED AMOUNT

In the Northwind Standard plan, an Allowed Amount is the maximum amount that the plan
will pay for a covered service. It includes both the amount that the plan pays and any
amount that the insured is responsible for paying. This total Allowed Amount is usually a
percentage of the provider's charge. In some cases, the Allowed Amount may be a fixed
amount.

In general, the Allowed Amount is the lesser of the provider's charge, the plan's Allowed
Amount, and the copayment amount. This means that the insured may be responsible for
paying the difference between the provider's charge and the Allowed Amount.

<!-- PageBreak -->

It is important to remember that the Allowed Amount may not cover the entire cost of a
service. Therefore, the insured may be responsible for paying any remaining balance, even if
it is more than the Allowed Amount.


### Exceptions:

In some cases, a service may not have an Allowed Amount or the Allowed Amount may be
higher than the provider's charge. This may occur when the service is considered to be a
non-covered service or when the service is not a usual or customary service. In these cases,
the insured will be responsible for paying the entire cost of the service.

In addition, some services may have a separate deductible or coinsurance amount that must
be met before the Allowed Amount is applied. These services may include hospitalization,
emergency services, and certain types of outpatient services.


### Tips:

When selecting a provider, ask the provider if they accept the Northwind Standard plan and
what their Allowed Amounts are. This will ensure that you are selecting a provider that will
accept the plan and that you are aware of what your out-of-pocket costs may be.

Make sure to keep all of your receipts and bills when you receive a service so that you can
review them against your Explanation of Benefits (EOB). This will ensure that you are
aware of any balance that may be owed after the Allowed Amount has been applied.

Finally, remember that the Allowed Amount is not a guarantee of payment and that you may
be responsible for paying any remaining balance. Therefore, it is important to review your
EOB and contact the provider if there are any discrepancies or if you have any questions
about the Allowed Amount.

Cellular Immunotherapy And Gene Therapy
Cellular Immunotherapy and Gene Therapy

Cellular immunotherapy and gene therapy are two cutting-edge treatments covered by
Northwind Standard. These treatments have the potential to revolutionize the way we treat
cancer and other diseases, and they offer a new, innovative approach to medical care.

Cellular immunotherapy is a form of treatment that uses the patient's own immune system
to fight off cancer cells. It works by taking cells from the patient and manipulating them in a
laboratory to make them better equipped to fight cancer. The modified cells are then
injected back into the patient's body, where they can help to fight off the cancer. This form
of treatment is still relatively new, but it has already been used to successfully treat some
types of cancer.

<!-- PageBreak -->

Gene therapy is a therapeutic modality that involves the introduction of exogenous genetic
material into an individual's cells for the purpose of modifying or correcting pathological
gene expression patterns. This process can be accomplished through various vectors,
including viral and non-viral delivery systems, with the aim of inducing therapeutic effects
through the modulation of cellular processes.

Northwind Standard covers both cellular immunotherapy and gene therapy. However, there
are some exceptions. These treatments are typically only available at specialized centers,
and they can be very expensive. As such, Northwind Standard may not cover the full cost of
the treatments. It is important to check with your provider to determine what is and is not
covered by your plan.

When considering cellular immunotherapy or gene therapy, it is important to do your
research. Make sure you understand the risks and benefits of the treatment, and be sure to
discuss any questions or concerns with your doctor. Additionally, it is important to have
realistic expectations about the results of the treatment. It is also important to remember
that these treatments are still in the early stages of development, and that their long-term
success is not yet known.

In summary, cellular immunotherapy and gene therapy are two cutting-edge treatments
that are now covered by Northwind Standard. While these treatments are still in the early
stages of development and may be expensive, they offer the potential to revolutionize the
way we treat diseases. It is important to do your research and discuss any questions or
concerns with your doctor before considering these treatments.


### Chemotherapy And Radiation Therapy COVERED SERVICES: Chemotherapy And Radiation Therapy

radiation therapy can be expensive. With Northwind Standard, we provide coverage for
these treatments, so you can have peace of mind knowing that your medical costs are taken
care of.

Chemotherapy involves using drugs to treat cancer and other conditions, while radiation
therapy uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer and other cells. Both types of treatments can

infections.

Under the Northwind Standard plan, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are both covered
services. This means that you will receive coverage for any eligible treatments that you

necessary. Additionally, the plan does not cover the cost of any hospital stays associated

Standard plan.

It is also important to remember that chemotherapy and radiation therapy can have side
effects. Make sure to discuss any potential side effects with your doctor before beginning
treatment. Additionally, make sure to follow your doctor's instructions carefully and take
any medications as prescribed.

Finally, make sure to keep track of your medical expenses. The Northwind Standard plan

should always take steps to avoid unnecessary visits. If you are feeling ill and it's not an

center before going to the emergency room. In most cases, these services are less expensive
and can provide the same level of care.

Finally, if you do need to visit the emergency room, you should be sure to keep all of your
paperwork and receipts. This will help you if you need to follow up with Northwind Health
about your claim.

Hospice Care
Hospice Care

At Contoso, we are proud to offer our employees access to Northwind Health's Standard
Plan, which includes coverage for hospice care. Hospice care is a specialized form of medical
care that focuses on providing comfort and support to individuals with a terminal illness.

Under this plan, hospice care can be covered when recommended by a doctor. This care is
typically provided in the patient's home or in a hospice facility. It can include medical,
social, spiritual, and emotional support for the patient and their family. Services typically
included in hospice care include nursing care, medical equipment and supplies, home health
aides, and prescription drugs.

Hospice care is an important part of end-of-life care. It focuses on providing comfort and
support to the patient and their family, rather than trying to cure the illness. It also provides
emotional support to help the patient and their family cope with the realities of the patient's
condition.

It is important to note that Northwind Standard only covers hospice care when it is
recommended by a doctor. This care must be provided by an in-network hospice provider.

<!-- PageBreak -->

Out-of-network providers are not covered under this plan. It is also important to note that
Northwind Standard does not cover the cost of room and board for hospice care provided in
a hospice facility.

We understand that these are difficult times for our employees and their families. We want
to make sure that our employees have access to the care and support they need to make the
most of their time together. We hope that this coverage will provide peace of mind and
support during this difficult time.

Here are a few tips to help our employees make the most of their hospice care coverage:

. Make sure to choose an in-network hospice provider to ensure your care is covered.

. Make sure to keep all of your medical records up-to-date and accessible. This will help
your doctor and hospice provider to provide the best care possible.

· Speak to your doctor and hospice provider about all of your options. They can provide
valuable guidance and support throughout the process.

. Make sure to take advantage of all of the resources available to you. Many hospice
providers offer counseling and support groups to help you and your family cope with the
situation.

. Make sure to keep track of all of your expenses related to hospice care. Northwind
Standard may cover some of your expenses, but you may have to pay for some out of pocket.
Keeping track of your expenses will help you stay organized.

We hope that this information is helpful and that our employees can take comfort knowing
that they have access to the care and support they need during this difficult time.

If you are in need of psychological or neuropsychological testing services, your first step
should be to speak with your primary care physician. He or she will determine if the tests
are medically necessary and can provide you with a referral to an in-network provider. It is
important to note that the Northwind Standard plan does not cover the cost of any tests that
are administered by an out-of-network provider.

When you are selecting an in-network provider for your psychological or
neuropsychological testing services, it is important to ensure that the provider is properly
licensed and highly qualified to perform the tests. You should also ask questions about the
provider's experience and training in order to ensure that you are receiving the highest
quality of care.

It is also important to remember that the Northwind Standard plan does not cover any costs
associated with psychological or neuropsychological testing that is done for research
purposes or for educational purposes. Additionally, the plan does not cover any costs
associated with psychological or neuropsychological testing that is done for non-medical
reasons such as pre-employment screening or for legal purposes.

In order to ensure that your psychological or neuropsychological testing services are
covered under the Northwind Standard plan, it is important to review your plan's Summary
of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) document. This document will provide you with a full list of
covered services, as well as any exceptions that may apply.

Overall, the Northwind Standard plan provides coverage for psychological and
neuropsychological testing services when they are prescribed or ordered by a health care
professional and when they are provided by an in-network provider. It is important to be
aware of any exceptions that may apply, as well as to select a highly qualified in-network
provider for your tests in order to ensure that your services are covered in full.

Skilled Nursing Facility Services
Skilled Nursing Facility Services

Skilled nursing facility (SNF) services are a key component of Northwind Standard health
plan coverage. The plan provides coverage for short-term care in a skilled nursing facility
for medically necessary services. The coverage is designed to help you receive the care you
need to help you recover from an illness or injury.

What Does Skilled Nursing Facility Care Include?

Skilled nursing facility care includes a wide range of services provided by a variety of
healthcare professionals, including trained nurses, therapists, social workers, and other
professionals to help you recover from an illness or injury. Services may include physical,
occupational, and speech therapy, medication management, wound care, intravenous
infusions, and other services that can help you regain independence and return home.

How Long Does Skilled Nursing Facility Care Last?

<!-- PageBreak -->

Your coverage for skilled nursing facility care is limited to a maximum of 100 days. In order
to continue to receive benefits, you must make measurable progress toward a goal that is
established by your doctor.

What Are the Exceptions to Skilled Nursing Facility Care Coverage?

Not all skilled nursing facility services are covered under Northwind Standard. The plan
does not cover custodial care or services that are not medically necessary. Custodial care
includes services that are provided to help you with activities of daily living such as bathing,
dressing, and other basic care.

Other exceptions to coverage include services provided in an assisted living facility, a
hospice, or in the home.

Tips for Getting the Most Out of Your Skilled Nursing Facility Care

. Make sure to communicate with your doctor and the skilled nursing facility staff about
your progress and treatment plan.

· Ask questions about any treatments or services that you are unfamiliar with.

· Check with your plan to make sure that any medications or treatments you receive are
covered under your plan.

home.

Spinal and Other Manipulations
COVERED SERVICES: Spinal and Other Manipulations

Northwind Standard offers coverage for spinal and other manipulations, including
chiropractic and osteopathic services. These services may be covered when they are
performed by a licensed chiropractor or osteopathic physician, and when they are medically
necessary. The plan covers manipulation of the spine and other joints, as well as the soft
tissues of the body. This can include the muscles, ligaments, and tendons that are associated
with the spine and joints.

The services must be performed by a licensed chiropractor or osteopathic physician. These
services may be performed on an outpatient basis, such as at a chiropractor's office, or in a
hospital or other facility.

It is important to note that Northwind Standard does not cover services that are not
medically necessary, or that are performed by someone who is not a licensed chiropractor
or osteopathic physician.

<!-- PageBreak -->

In some cases, coverage for spinal and other manipulations may be subject to pre-
authorization or pre-certification. If your provider requires pre-authorization or pre-
certification, you should contact Northwind Health prior to receiving the services to ensure
that they are covered.

It is also important to understand that coverage for spinal and other manipulations may be
limited. Northwind Standard does not cover services for the purpose of maintenance or
prevention of disease, nor does it cover services that are experimental in nature.

If your provider recommends spinal or other manipulations, it is important to make sure
that you understand the risks and benefits associated with the service. Make sure that you
ask questions about how the service will be performed and what the expected results will
be. Make sure that you understand what the potential risks and complications are and that
you are comfortable with the provider's approach.

It is also important to understand that spinal and other manipulations may be covered by
other insurance plans or by other sources. Be sure to check with your provider to see if
there are any additional coverage options available.

Finally, it is important to remember that spinal and other manipulations are not a substitute
for other forms of medical care. If you have any questions or concerns about your health,
you should always speak to your doctor or other health care provider.

Substance Use Disorder
Substance Use Disorder

At Contoso, we understand that substance use disorder is a serious issue that can have a
devastating impact on individuals and their families. We are proud to offer our employees
access to Northwind Standard, a health plan that provides coverage for substance use
disorder treatment services.

Northwind Standard covers substance use disorder treatment services when they are
medically necessary, including inpatient and outpatient care, as well as counseling. This
coverage also includes medically necessary medications that are used to treat substance use
disorder.

In addition, Northwind Standard provides coverage for certain services that are not
typically covered by other health plans, such as detoxification services, residential
treatment services, and recovery support services.

While Northwind Standard does provide coverage for substance use disorder treatment
services, there are some exceptions to this coverage. For example, Northwind Standard does
not cover services that are provided in a hospital emergency room or a hospital inpatient
setting unless they are medically necessary and pre-authorized by Northwind Health.

We understand that substance use disorder can have a devastating impact, and we want to
make sure that our employees have access to the care they need. If you have any questions

<!-- PageBreak -->

about Northwind Standard's coverage for substance use disorder services, please contact
Northwind Health and speak to one of our customer service representatives.

Surgery
Surgery

Surgery is a common medical service and is covered under the Northwind Standard plan.
You will be able to use in-network providers for your surgery, as long as it's deemed
medically necessary by your doctor.

The amount of coverage you receive for surgery depends on the type of surgery you need.
Generally, simple and routine surgeries are covered at 100%, while major or complex
surgeries may be covered at a lower rate. You can check with your insurance provider to
learn more about the coverage for specific surgeries.

Before you receive surgery, you'll need to get pre-authorization from your insurance
provider. Pre-authorization means that your insurance provider has approved the surgery
and the amount of coverage you'll receive. If you don't get pre-authorization, you may be
responsible for all the costs of the surgery.

<!-- PageBreak -->

You'll also need to make sure that you have a referral from your primary care physician if
you're seeing a specialist for surgery. If you don't have a referral, your insurance provider
may not cover the cost of the surgery.

If you need to stay overnight in a hospital after your surgery, your Northwind Standard plan
will cover the cost of the hospital stay. However, you may have to pay a copay for each day
you stay in the hospital.

In some cases, you may need to pay for part of the cost of the surgery. This is called
coinsurance, which is a percentage of the cost that you pay out-of-pocket. The coinsurance
rate for surgeries is usually around 20%, but it can vary depending on the type of surgery
and the insurance provider.

Some types of surgery are not covered by the Northwind Standard plan. These may include
cosmetic surgery, elective surgery, and any type of experimental surgery. You'll need to
check with your insurance provider to find out which surgeries are covered and which are
not.

When it comes to surgery, it's important to plan ahead and make sure that you understand
your insurance coverage. Make sure to get pre-authorization, get a referral from your
primary care physician, and get an estimate of the cost of the surgery. This will help ensure
that your surgery is covered and that you're not left with unexpected costs.

Surgical Center Care - Outpatient
Surgical Center Care - Outpatient

At Northwind Health, we understand that having access to quality and affordable care is
important. That's why we offer coverage for surgical center care - outpatient services in our
Northwind Standard plan.

When it comes to surgical center care, Northwind Health provides coverage for procedures
that require care at an outpatient surgical center. This includes surgery, as well as related
services, such as lab tests, x-rays, and certain medications. This coverage is subject to
certain restrictions, such as prior authorization, medical necessity, and applicable
copayments or coinsurance.

It's important to note that Northwind Standard does not cover services provided in a
hospital outpatient department. If you need care in a hospital outpatient setting, you will
need to pay the full cost of the services not covered.

If you need a surgical procedure, your primary care physician will likely refer you to a
specialist who can provide the care you need. Make sure to ask questions and get all the
information you need before you have your procedure. Also, make sure to check if the
specialist is in-network with Northwind Health. That way, you can be sure that your
procedure will be covered by your plan.

<!-- PageBreak -->

When you visit the surgical center, you may be asked to sign a form acknowledging that you
are responsible for any costs that are not covered by your plan. It's important to read this
form carefully, so you know what you're agreeing to.

If you need to have a procedure done at an outpatient surgical center, make sure to contact
Northwind Health beforehand. You can call our customer service team at 1-800-555-1234
and they will help you understand what services are covered by your plan and how to get
the care you need.

At Northwind Health, we are committed to providing quality and affordable health care
services. We are here to help you get the care you need, when you need it.

Temporomandibular Joint Disorders (TMJ) Care
COVERED SERVICES: Temporomandibular Joint Disorders (TMJ) Care

The Northwind Standard plan includes coverage for Temporomandibular Joint Disorders
(TMJ) Care. TMJ care is the diagnosis and management of disorders of the
temporomandibular joint, which is the joint that connects the lower jaw to the skull. TMJ
care can include diagnostics such as x-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and other tests or treatments,
including physical therapy, medications, and surgery.

The Northwind Standard plan does not cover certain TMJ treatments and services, such as
treatment for bruxism, TMJ splint therapy, or orthodontic treatment. Additionally, any
services or treatments that are deemed to be experimental or investigational are not
covered by the Northwind Standard plan.

Employees with this plan should be aware that they may be subject to preauthorization
requirements when seeking TMJ care. Preauthorization is a process in which a health
insurance company reviews the medical necessity of a treatment or procedure prior to
authorizing payment. This means that the employee must obtain approval from the
insurance company before receiving the treatment or procedure.

When seeking TMJ care, it is important for the employee to discuss their condition and
treatment options with their healthcare provider. The healthcare provider can recommend
specific treatments and services that are appropriate for the employee's condition and can
help the employee understand if their treatment is covered by the Northwind Standard
plan. It is also important for the employee to understand their financial responsibility prior
to receiving treatment. This includes any copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles that may
be applicable.

In addition to discussing treatment options with their healthcare provider, employees
should also be proactive in managing their TMJ condition. This includes avoiding activities
that can exacerbate the problem, such as grinding teeth or chewing gum, and practicing
relaxation techniques to reduce stress. Additionally, employees should practice good
posture and avoid sleeping on their stomach to reduce strain on the jaw. Practicing good

<!-- PageBreak -->

oral hygiene is also important, as TMJ can be caused by dental problems such as
misalignment of the teeth.

Finally, employees should be aware that TMJ is a chronic condition, which means that it may
require ongoing management. Regular visits to the healthcare provider for diagnosis and
treatment may be necessary in order to manage the condition. Employees should also be
aware that the Northwind Standard plan does not cover all TMJ treatments, so it is
important to understand their financial responsibility for any treatment that is not covered.

In conclusion, the Northwind Standard plan does provide coverage for TMJ care, but there
may be certain treatments and services that are not covered. It is important for employees
to understand their financial responsibility prior to receiving treatment, and to discuss their
condition and treatment options with their healthcare provider. Additionally, it is important
for employees to practice good posture, avoid activities that can exacerbate the problem,
and practice good oral hygiene in order to manage their TMJ condition.


### Therapeutic Injections Therapeutic Injections

Therapeutic injections are a covered service under the Northwind Standard plan. This
means that members of the Northwind Standard plan will be eligible for coverage for
certain therapeutic injections. This coverage includes the cost of both the injection and the
injection materials.

The Northwind Standard plan covers therapeutic injections when they are medically
necessary and prescribed by a physician. Injections that are medically necessary are those
that are necessary to treat, diagnose, or prevent a medical condition that has been
diagnosed by a physician. This means that the injection must be part of the treatment plan
for a medical condition that has been diagnosed by a physician.

The Northwind Standard plan does not cover injections for cosmetic purposes or for
treatment of any condition that has not been diagnosed by a physician.

In order for a therapeutic injection to be covered by the Northwind Standard plan, the
injection must be administered by a physician or other qualified healthcare provider. The
injection must also be administered in a medically appropriate setting, such as a hospital or
physician's office. Injections that are administered in non-medical settings, such as a
pharmacy, are not covered by the Northwind Standard plan.

Members of the Northwind Standard plan may be responsible for any co-payments,
coinsurance, or deductibles associated with the therapeutic injection. The amount of the co-
payment, coinsurance, or deductible will be determined by the member's specific plan.

When considering a therapeutic injection, members should talk to their physician or other
qualified healthcare provider about the risks, benefits, and potential side effects of the
injection. It is also important to discuss any other treatments or medications that may be

<!-- PageBreak -->

necessary in order to get the best possible outcome for the medical condition that is being
treated.

It is also important to note that therapeutic injections may not be covered under all
Northwind Standard plans. Members should check with their plan administrator to
determine if a specific therapeutic injection is covered under their plan.

When a therapeutic injection is covered by the Northwind Standard plan, the member
should always confirm that the injection is being administered by a qualified healthcare
provider in a medically appropriate setting. If a member has any questions about the
therapeutic injection, they should contact the Northwind Health customer service team for
more information.

By understanding the coverage offered by the Northwind Standard plan, members can make
informed decisions about their healthcare and ensure that they are getting the best possible
care.

Transplants
COVERED SERVICES - Transplants

At Northwind Health, we understand how important it is to have access to the best possible
care. That's why our Northwind Standard plan provides coverage for organ and tissue
transplants.

If you need a transplant of any kind, Northwind Standard will cover the expenses associated
with the procedure, including the cost of the donor organ, hospital stays, recovery costs, and
medications. It's important to note that transplants are subject to certain criteria, including
a determination of medical necessity, so it's important to discuss your transplant needs
with your primary care physician.

In addition to covering the cost of the transplant itself, Northwind Standard will also
provide coverage for pre- and post-transplant care, such as laboratory tests, diagnostic
tests, and other medically necessary services. It's important to note that there are some
exceptions to coverage for transplants. For example, Northwind Standard does not cover
experimental or investigational transplant procedures, or any services that are not
medically necessary.

When it comes to making sure you get the best care possible, we believe that the best
approach is to work with your doctor to determine the best course of action. It's important
to note that coverage for transplants is subject to preauthorization, so it's important to
make sure that you get the necessary authorization for any transplant procedures before
you move forward.

There are also a few tips that can help make sure that you get the most out of your
Northwind Standard coverage for transplants. For example, it's important to make sure that
you are familiar with all of the details of your coverage, including any applicable copays or

<!-- PageBreak -->

coinsurance requirements. It's also a good idea to ask your doctor about any potential out-
of-pocket costs you may need to pay, as well as any potential alternative treatments that
may be available.

Finally, it's important to note that Northwind Standard does not provide coverage for any
experimental or investigational transplant procedures. If you're considering a transplant
procedure, it's important to make sure that it is a medically necessary procedure, and that it
is covered under your Northwind Standard plan.

At Northwind Health, we understand how important it is for our members to have access to
the best possible care. That's why we're proud to provide coverage for organ and tissue
transplants through our Northwind Standard plan. With this coverage, you can get the care
you need, while also enjoying the peace of mind that comes from knowing that your
transplant procedure is covered.

Urgent Care
\\# COVERED SERVICES: Urgent Care

At Northwind Health, our Northwind Standard plan covers urgent care services. Urgent care
services are typically for medical issues that cannot wait for a scheduled appointment with
a primary care provider. Examples of conditions that would be covered under urgent care
include ear infections, allergic reactions, minor broken bones, and insect or animal bites.

Northwind Health's Northwind Standard plan covers urgent care services provided by in-
network providers. The coverage includes visits to urgent care centers and emergency
rooms. It is important to note that while emergency rooms are covered, they should only be
used in the event of a true medical emergency. In the case of a medical emergency, go to the
nearest emergency room or call 911 right away.

To help you determine whether a condition requires urgent care or can wait for a scheduled
appointment, Northwind Health provides access to telemedicine services. Telemedicine
services are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Through these services, you can
talk to a doctor or nurse practitioner who can help you determine if a condition is
appropriate for urgent care or should be treated with a scheduled appointment.

When seeking urgent care services, it is important to keep in mind that you may be
responsible for some out-of-pocket costs. This includes co-pays, co-insurance, and
deductibles. The amount you are responsible for will depend on your plan and the type of
services you receive. To help you better understand your coverage, Northwind Health
provides access to an online cost estimator tool. This tool allows you to search for specific
services and get an estimate of what you will be responsible for. It is important to note that
the estimates provided are only estimates, and the actual cost may vary.

Finally, Northwind Health's Northwind Standard plan does not cover services that are not
medically necessary. Examples of services that are not covered include cosmetic procedures

<!-- PageBreak -->

and elective treatments. Additionally, the plan does not cover services that are not related
to the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury.

At Northwind Health, we are committed to helping you get the care you need when you
need it. We understand that medical issues can arise suddenly and can be unpredictable.
That is why we offer coverage for urgent care services through our Northwind Standard
plan. If you have any questions about your coverage, please contact our customer service
team.

Virtual Care

COVERED SERVICES: VIRTUAL CARE

At Northwind Health, we understand that our members may have difficulty accessing in-
person care. That is why we offer virtual care, allowing members to access care from the
comfort of their own home. With virtual care, members can talk to a doctor or nurse
practitioner by phone or video call, receive a diagnosis and treatment, and get prescriptions
sent to their pharmacy of choice.

Northwind Standard covers virtual care services in the same way it would cover an in-
person visit. This includes a variety of services, such as urgent care, primary care, mental
health and substance abuse services, and specialist visits. Members also have access to
telehealth post-discharge care and chronic disease management.

Exceptions

Although Northwind Standard covers most virtual care services, there are a few exceptions.
Virtual care is not covered for any services that require a physical exam, such as pediatric
well-child visits, physical therapy, and lab work. Additionally, virtual care is not covered for
any services that require in-person care, such as surgeries and imaging tests.


#### Tips for Members

We want to make sure our members get the most out of their virtual care visits. Here are a
few tips to help make your virtual care visits as successful as possible:

\\- Make sure your doctor is in-network. Northwind Standard covers virtual care services for
in-network providers only.

\\- Have your medical records on hand. Your doctor or nurse practitioner will need to see
your medical records during the visit, so make sure to have them available.

\\- Have a list of questions ready. Make sure to write down any questions you have before the
visit so that you can get the most out of it.

\\- Follow up with your doctor. After the virtual care visit, make sure to follow up with your
doctor if needed.

## WHAT DO I DO IF I'M OUTSIDE WASHINGTON?

Out-Of-Area Care

WHAT DO I DO IF I'M OUTSIDE WASHINGTON?

If you find yourself outside of Washington and in need of medical care, Northwind Standard
provides coverage for out-of-area emergency services. You will be covered for medically
necessary services and supplies to treat a sudden and unexpected illness or injury. You are
also covered for emergency services related to a pre-existing condition.

It is important to know that Northwind Standard does not provide coverage for non-
emergency services outside of Washington. That means you may be responsible for the full
cost of care if you seek out care for a condition that could have been treated in Washington.

In order to receive coverage for out-of-area care, you must meet the following criteria:

. You must be outside of Washington for no more than 12 consecutive months

. You must be more than 100 miles away from your primary care provider

· Your plan must have been in effect for at least 6 months before you receive out-of-area
care

If you meet the criteria listed above, you may be eligible for coverage of out-of-area services.
In order to receive coverage, you must contact Northwind Health in advance of receiving
care. You must also obtain prior authorization for any care you wish to receive. If prior
authorization is not obtained, you may be responsible for the full cost of care.

If you are outside of Washington for more than 12 consecutive months, you may not be
eligible for coverage of out-of-area services. In this case, you may need to seek out a new
plan that offers coverage in the state where you are living.

<!-- PageBreak -->

It is important to note that Northwind Standard does not cover out-of-network services
outside of Washington. This means that you will need to find in-network providers in the
state where you are living to receive coverage.

It is also important to keep in mind that the cost of care can vary widely outside of
Washington. You should contact Northwind Health to get an estimate of the cost of care for
services you may need. This can help you make an informed decision about where to obtain
care.

Finally, it is important to keep your Northwind Standard plan active while you are out of
state. This will ensure that you remain eligible for coverage if you need to receive out-of-
area care.

By following the tips outlined above, you can ensure that you are prepared if you find
yourself needing care outside of Washington. Northwind Standard provides coverage for
out-of-area emergency services, but it does not provide coverage for non-emergency
services, out-of-network services, or care received outside of Washington for more than 12
consecutive months. Prior authorization must also be obtained in order to receive coverage.
Keeping your plan active while out of state will also ensure that you remain eligible for
coverage.


### CARE MANAGEMENT

Prior-Authorization

CARE MANAGEMENT: Prior Authorization

Northwind Standard includes Care Management services, which are designed to provide
support, information, and proactive care for members. Specifically, this plan includes a Prior
Authorization (PA) process for certain services.

Prior Authorization is a process used by Northwind Health to make sure that a covered
service is medically necessary and is the most cost-effective way to receive the service.
Before certain services are approved and covered, an authorization must be requested from
Northwind Health. This authorization can be requested by either the provider or the
member.

If you require a service that requires prior authorization, you must make sure that it is
requested and approved before you receive the service. If prior authorization is not
obtained, Northwind Health may not cover the service.


#### Exceptions

There are certain services that are exempt from the prior authorization process. These
include:

\\- Preventive care services, such as annual physicals or vaccinations

<!-- PageBreak -->

\\- Services provided in an emergency care setting

\\- Services provided in an outpatient hospital setting

\\- Services provided in an urgent care setting

\\- Services provided in a skilled nursing facility

Tips

If you have any questions about the prior authorization process, Northwind Health
recommends that you contact them at least five business days before the scheduled service.
This will allow you to receive the necessary authorization in a timely manner.

You can contact Northwind Health by calling their customer service number or sending an
email. If you call, make sure to have your health plan identification number handy.

Additionally, if you receive a service without prior authorization, you may be responsible
for the full cost of the service. Therefore, if you are unsure about whether a service requires
authorization, contact Northwind Health for more information.

In order to make the prior authorization process as easy as possible, Northwind Health has
made it possible to submit requests online. You can access this service through the
Northwind Health website.

If you would like to make a prior authorization request via mail, you can send the request
to:

Northwind Health Prior Authorization Department

PO Box 1234
Anytown, USA 00000

Northwind Health also offers a patient advocacy program to help you with the prior
authorization process. This program can provide assistance with filing appeals, finding
specialists, and understanding insurance terms.

By understanding the prior authorization process, you can ensure that your services are
covered by your Northwind Health plan. If you have any questions about the services that
require authorization or about the process itself, contact Northwind Health for more
information.

How Prior-Authorization Works
CARE MANAGEMENT: How Prior-Authorization Works

Prior authorization is a process that Northwind Standard uses to help ensure that members
receive medically necessary, cost-effective, and appropriate services. With prior

<!-- PageBreak -->

authorization, services must be approved by Northwind Health before you can receive
them. This process helps ensure that members receive the right care at the right time.

There are certain services that require prior authorization before the service is rendered.
These services can include, but are not limited to, hospital stays, certain laboratory tests,
certain imaging services, physical therapy, and durable medical equipment. Northwind
Health may also require prior authorization for drugs that are not on the Northwind
Standard formulary.

When you or your doctor request a service that requires prior authorization, Northwind
Health will review the request. Northwind Health will then decide if the service is medically
necessary and covered under Northwind Standard. Northwind Health will notify you and
your doctor of the decision within three business days.

If Northwind Health approves the service, you may receive the service without any
additional pre-authorization. However, if Northwind Health denies coverage, you may be
able to appeal the decision. You can contact Northwind Health by phone or mail to submit
an appeal.

Northwind Health may also review claims after the services have been provided. This
process is called retrospective review and is used to ensure that the services provided were
medically necessary and appropriate. Northwind Health may also use this process to detect
fraud and abuse.

When requesting prior authorization, it is important to provide Northwind Health with all
the necessary information. This includes a complete medical history and diagnosis, as well
as any other relevant information. Northwind Health may also request additional
information or tests to make a decision.

When requesting prior authorization, it is important to plan ahead. Northwind Health must
receive all the necessary information before the requested service is provided. If Northwind
Health does not receive all the necessary information, the prior authorization request may
be denied.

When requesting prior authorization, it is also important to check with your doctor to make
sure the service is covered under Northwind Standard. Some services may not be covered,
even if prior authorization is approved.

Finally, if the service is approved, make sure to keep a copy of the authorization. This will
help ensure that you receive the coverage you are entitled to.

Prior authorization can be a complicated process. However, it is important to remember
that it is in place to help ensure that members receive the right care at the right time.
Northwind Health is committed to helping members make informed decisions about their
health care.

##### Prior-Authorization for Benefit Coverage CARE MANAGEMENT: Prior-Authorization for Benefit Coverage

At Northwind Health, Contoso's employees have access to a variety of healthcare benefits,
including coverage for medical, vision, and dental services. With Northwind Standard,
employees can also choose from a variety of in-network providers for their care. However,
in order to get the most out of their benefit coverage, employees should be aware of the
prior-authorization process for certain services and treatments.

Prior-authorization is a process in which Northwind Health requires Contoso's employees
to get approval from their plan before receiving certain services or treatments. This process
helps ensure that the care is necessary and medically appropriate. If prior-authorization is
not obtained, the employee may be responsible for the full cost of any services or
treatments that are received without approval.

Some services or treatments that may require prior-authorization include, but are not
limited to, hospital stays, certain medical procedures, durable medical equipment, and
certain prescription drugs. In order to obtain prior-authorization, the employee's physician
must submit a request to Northwind Health. The request will then be reviewed by
Northwind Health to determine if the service or treatment is medically necessary and if it is
a covered benefit under the Northwind Standard plan.

In some cases, Northwind Health may also require that the employee meet certain criteria
in order to be approved for a service or treatment. These criteria may include specific
medical tests or treatments, lifestyle changes, or other requirements. If the employee is
unable to meet the criteria, prior-authorization may not be granted.

There are some exceptions to the prior-authorization process. For example, preventive care
services and emergency services are not subject to prior-authorization. In addition, mental
health and substance abuse coverage is not subject to prior-authorization. However, out-of-
network services are subject to prior-authorization and may require additional cost to the
employee.

Here are some tips for Contoso's employees to help them navigate the prior-authorization
process:

· Contact your physician's office to determine if prior-authorization is required before
receiving a service or treatment.

. Contact Northwind Health to determine if a service or treatment is a covered benefit
under Northwind Standard.

· Ask your physician to submit a request for prior-authorization as soon as possible.

· Understand the criteria that may be required for prior-authorization and be prepared to
meet those criteria if necessary.

<!-- PageBreak -->

· Be aware of any exceptions to the prior-authorization process, such as preventive care and
emergency services.

By understanding the prior-authorization process and following these tips, Contoso's
employees can ensure that they get the most out of their benefit coverage.

Prior-Authorization For Out-Of-Network Provider Coverage

CARE MANAGEMENT - Prior-Authorization For Out-Of-Network Provider Coverage

Out-of-network providers are not included in the Northwind Standard plan, but you may be
able to receive coverage for certain services by obtaining prior authorization. Prior
authorization is a process that ensures that the service or medication you receive is
medically necessary, and that it is covered by your plan.

In order to get coverage for out-of-network services, you must make sure to get prior
authorization from Northwind Health. This is done by contacting the Northwind Health
Customer Service team, who will review the request and provide you with a decision. If
your request is approved, you will be covered for the service or medication. If it is not
approved, you will not be covered.

When requesting prior authorization for an out-of-network provider, you should make sure
to provide Northwind Health with all the necessary information, including:

· The name, address, and contact information of the out-of-network provider.

· The date of service.

· The diagnosis or reason for the service.

· The type of service or medication requested.

. The estimated cost of the service or medication.

<!-- PageBreak -->

It is important to note that, in some cases, Northwind Health may require additional

request for prior authorization if the service or medication is not medically necessary, or if
it is not covered by your plan.

When requesting prior authorization for an out-of-network provider, it is important to keep
in mind that the process can take up to several days or even weeks. Therefore, it is
important to start the process as soon as possible. Additionally, it is important to remember
that you will be responsible for paying for the service or medication if Northwind Health

prior authorization. If you are unsure whether a service requires prior authorization or
precertification, you can contact the Northwind Health Customer Service team for
assistance.

In summary, prior authorization is required for out-of-network services that are covered by
the Northwind Standard plan. It is important to make sure to contact Northwind Health as

###### Exceptions to Prior-Authorization For Out-Of-Network Providers CARE MANAGEMENT: Exceptions to Prior-Authorization For Out-Of-Network Providers

At Northwind Health, we offer a variety of options for care management and prior
authorization of out-of-network providers. We understand that there are circumstances
when the care needed is not available through an in-network provider, and so we make
exceptions to the prior-authorization requirement.

First and foremost, it's important to note that prior authorization is not required for
emergency services. If you find yourself in an emergency situation, you can immediately
seek out the care you need without worrying about getting prior authorization.

In addition, prior authorization is not necessary for emergency services provided in a
foreign country. This includes both medical and dental services. However, it's important to

<!-- PageBreak -->

remember that Northwind Standard does not cover out-of-network services in foreign
countries.

In rare cases, prior authorization may also be waived for services that are not available in-
network. If the care you need is not available through an in-network provider, you can seek
out an out-of-network provider without obtaining prior authorization. However, you should
be aware that you may be responsible for any costs associated with out-of-network
services.

In order to ensure that you are receiving the best care possible, it's important to understand
the basics of prior authorization. Prior authorization is a process in which your insurance
company reviews the request and verifies the need for the service or procedure. This helps
to ensure that you receive the appropriate care and that the costs associated with the care
are covered by your plan.

If you're considering seeking care from an out-of-network provider, it's important to
remember that prior authorization is required for out-of-network services. You should call
Northwind Health to obtain prior authorization before you receive care from an out-of-
network provider.

It's also important to know that prior authorization may be denied if the service or
procedure is not medically necessary or not covered under your plan. If prior authorization
is denied, you may be responsible for any costs associated with the care.

At Northwind Health, we understand that there are times when care is not available
through an in-network provider. That's why we make exceptions to the prior-authorization
requirement for certain services and procedures. However, it's important to remember that
prior authorization is still required for most out-of-network services.

If you have any questions about prior authorization for out-of-network providers, please
contact Northwind Health. We're here to help you get the care you need, and we're here to
help you understand the process of prior authorization.

Clinical Review
CARE MANAGEMENT: Clinical Review

The Northwind Standard plan offers a variety of care management services to help ensure
that members receive quality, cost-effective care. These services include clinical review,
which is a process that evaluates the medical necessity and appropriateness of a proposed
course of treatment, as well as any adjustment or changes to existing treatments.

Clinical review is conducted by Northwind Health's Medical Management Department,
which is staffed by licensed clinicians who are experienced in the various medical
conditions and treatments that are covered by the Northwind Standard plan. These
clinicians use evidence-based guidelines and other important criteria to evaluate the
proposed course of treatment and make sure that it is medically necessary and appropriate.

<!-- PageBreak -->

Northwind Health utilizes a three-level clinical review process. The first level of review
involves a Registered Nurse (RN) or Medical Doctor (MD) evaluating the proposed course of
treatment. If the RN or MD determines that the proposed course of treatment is medically
necessary, then the case is approved and the member can proceed with the treatment. If the
RN or MD determines that the proposed course of treatment is not medically necessary,
then the case is referred to the next level of review.

At the second level of review, the case is evaluated by a Medical Director, who is an MD or
Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO). The Medical Director reviews the case and makes a
final determination as to whether the proposed course of treatment is medically necessary
or not. If the Medical Director approves the case, then the member can proceed with the
treatment. If the Medical Director does not approve the case, then the case is referred to the
third level of review.

At the third and final level of review, the case is evaluated by a Medical Review Officer, who
is an MD or DO. The Medical Review Officer reviews the case and makes a final
determination as to whether the proposed course of treatment is medically necessary or
not. If the Medical Review Officer approves the case, then the member can proceed with the
treatment. If the Medical Review Officer does not approve the case, then the member is not
eligible to receive the treatment.

The Northwind Standard plan also offers several exceptions to the clinical review process.
For example, certain types of medical services are exempt from clinical review and can be
approved without going through the process. Additionally, certain time-sensitive services
may be approved without going through the clinical review process if the member's health
is in immediate danger.

It is important for members to understand the clinical review process and the exceptions
that are available. Members should be aware that some medical services may require pre-
authorization before they can be approved, and that the clinical review process may take
some time. Additionally, members should keep in mind that the clinical review process is
designed to ensure that medically necessary treatments are provided in a timely and cost-
effective manner.

To help ensure that the clinical review process runs smoothly and quickly, members should
provide accurate and detailed information about their medical needs when requesting
treatment. This includes a complete list of their current medications, as well as all relevant
medical history. Additionally, members should provide any necessary documentation that
may be required, such as test results or lab reports. Finally, members should make sure that
they understand the process and any exceptions that may apply.

Overall, the clinical review process is an important component of the Northwind Standard
plan, and it helps to ensure that members receive high-quality, cost-effective care. The
process is designed to be straightforward and efficient, and the exceptions that are available
can help to ensure that members receive the care they need in a timely manner. By

<!-- PageBreak -->

understanding the clinical review process and the exceptions that are available, members
can help to ensure that they receive the care they need in a timely and cost-effective
manner.

cost of those services.

3\\. If you require mental health or substance abuse treatments, be sure to check with your
provider to see if they are part of the Northwind Health network. These services are not
covered by the Northwind Standard plan.

4\\. If you require services from a provider that is not part of the Northwind Health network,

WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?

Coordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans

WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?

Coordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans

It may be possible to coordinate benefits with other health care plans if you have other
coverage. Coordinating benefits allows you to receive payments from each health plan
towards covered services, as long as the total amount of payments does not exceed the total
charges for the service.

If you have other coverage, such as Medicare or an employer-sponsored health plan, the
Northwind Standard plan may be able to coordinate benefits with those plans. This can help
reduce your out-of-pocket costs for health care services.

How Do I Coordinate Benefits with Other Plans?

<!-- PageBreak -->

If you have other health care coverage, you should contact the other health care plan(s) to
determine how to coordinate benefits. Depending on the plans you have, you may be able to
coordinate benefits by filing a claim with both plans.

You will need to provide the other plan with a copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB)
from the Northwind Health plan. The EOB is a summary of the services you received and
how much the Northwind Health plan paid for those services.

When filing a claim with the other health care plan, you may also need to provide a copy of
your bill or invoice. The other plan may require additional information as part of the claim
process.

You should keep copies of all documentation that you submit to the other plan. This can
help you track your claim and follow up with the other plan if there are any delays in
processing.


#### Exceptions

Coordination of benefits with other plans is not available for all types of services. For
example, coordination of benefits will not be available for services related to emergency
care, mental health and substance abuse treatment, or services received from out-of-
network providers.

Tips for Coordinating Benefits

· Contact your other health care plan to determine whether you can coordinate benefits and
what documentation you need to provide.

· Keep copies of all documentation you submit to the other plan, including bills and
invoices.

· Follow up with the other plan if there are any delays in processing the claim.

. Be sure to read all of the plan documents and understand your coverage options.

. If you have any questions, contact the Northwind Health customer service team for
assistance.

COB Definitions

WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?

At Contoso, we want our employees to understand the concept of COB (Coordination of
Benefits) so they can make the best decisions when it comes to their health care coverage.
COB is a system used to determine which health plan pays first when an employee has more
than one health plan.

When an employee has multiple health plans, the health plan that pays first is determined
by the order of benefit determination. Generally, the employee's primary health plan pays

<!-- PageBreak -->

first, followed by the secondary health plan. However, if one of the health plans is a
Medicare or Medicaid plan, that plan pays first.

Under the Northwind Standard Plan, if you have other coverage, you may be able to use the
network providers and services that are covered by Northwind Standard at a lower cost.
However, the cost of services obtained from providers that are not in the Northwind
Standard network will not be covered by the plan.

When you receive health care services, it's important to identify all of your coverage to the
provider to ensure that they bill each health plan appropriately. This helps to ensure that
you receive the full benefits offered by each plan. If you do not identify all of your health
coverage, it may result in a delay of payment or denial of coverage.

When you submit a claim to Northwind Standard, you'll need to include information about
the other coverage you have. If the claim is sent to Northwind Standard before any other
plan, the claim will be processed based on the Northwind Standard plan benefits.

It's important to remember that Northwind Standard does not coordinate benefits with
other coverage. This means that Northwind Standard will not adjust the amount of payment
made to a provider to take into account payments from other coverage. If a provider has
been paid by another plan, you are still responsible for the balance due after Northwind
Standard pays its portion of the claim.

If you have other coverage, it's important to review the benefits of each plan to make sure
you are taking full advantage of your coverage. If you need help understanding your plan
benefits or have any questions about the coordination of benefits, please contact the
Northwind Standard Plan Customer Service team. We're here to help!


##### Primary And Secondary Rules

WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?

If you have other health coverage, such as coverage through a spouse's plan, Northwind
Standard may become your secondary coverage. This means that Northwind Standard will
pay for eligible expenses after the other coverage pays.

The primary and secondary rules that apply to Northwind Standard are important to
understand. When you have two types of health coverage, the primary plan pays first and
the secondary plan pays second. The primary plan is the plan that is responsible for paying
the largest portion of your healthcare costs.

For example, if you have a spouse's health plan and Northwind Standard, your spouse's plan
would be the primary plan and Northwind Standard would be the secondary plan. This
means that your spouse's plan would pay for the majority of your healthcare costs and
Northwind Standard would pay for any remaining costs.

It's important to note that Northwind Standard will only pay for expenses that are not
covered by the primary plan. Additionally, Northwind Standard will not pay any expenses

<!-- PageBreak -->

that exceed the limits of the primary plan. For example, if the primary plan has a $1,000
deductible and Northwind Standard has a $500 deductible, only the $500 deductible from
the primary plan will be paid.

There are some exceptions to the primary and secondary rules. For instance, if you have
Medicare coverage, it will be the primary coverage for medical expenses and Northwind
Standard will be the secondary coverage. However, if you have Medicare Part D for
prescription drugs, Northwind Standard will be the primary coverage and Medicare Part D
will be the secondary coverage.

It's also important to keep in mind that if you have other health coverage, you may need to
provide evidence of that coverage to your health plan. This is known as \"creditable
coverage,\" and it helps to ensure that Northwind Standard will pay any eligible expenses
once the primary plan has paid.

When it comes to understanding primary and secondary rules, it's important to remember
that each health plan is different. Be sure to review your plan documents to understand the
specific rules and restrictions that apply to your coverage.

Finally, if you have any questions or concerns about your coverage, be sure to reach out to
Northwind Health. Their knowledgeable customer service representatives are always
available to answer your questions and provide guidance on how best to use your coverage.

COB's Effect On Benefits

WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?

When you have other health insurance coverage, coordination of benefits (COB) can affect
how your benefits are paid. COB is a process where your insurance companies coordinate
who pays first when you have multiple health insurance plans that cover the same medical
expenses. The insurance company that pays first is called the primary payer, and the
company that pays second is called the secondary payer.

Coordination of Benefits Exceptions

There are a few exceptions to COB rules that may apply to you. If you are covered by
Medicare, Medicaid, or a veterans' health plan, Northwind Standard may pay first, even if
the other plan is usually the primary payer. Additionally, if you are enrolled in a plan that is
required by law to coordinate benefits, such as an employer-sponsored plan, Northwind
Standard may pay first.

Understanding How COB Affects Your Benefits

When COB applies, the primary and secondary payers will each pay a portion of the eligible
expenses and combined payments cannot exceed the total cost. Depending on the type of
service, the primary payer may pay all of the eligible expenses. When this happens, the
secondary payer may pay nothing.

<!-- PageBreak -->

For example, if you receive a medical bill for $1,000 and the primary payer pays $800, the
secondary payer will pay the remaining balance of $200. However, if the primary payer
pays the full $1,000, the secondary payer will not pay anything.

Tips for Working with COB

When you have multiple health insurance plans, it's important to understand how COB
works and how it can affect your benefits. Here are a few tips to help you manage your
benefits:

. Make sure that each insurance company has all of the necessary information about your
other coverage, including plan numbers and policy dates.

· Confirm that your primary and secondary payers have updated information about each
other.

· Ask your health care providers to submit claims to both insurance companies.

· Understand any limitations or exclusions that may apply to your benefits.

. If you have questions, contact each insurance company for clarification.

Overall, it's important to understand how COB works and how it affects your benefits. By
being aware of the rules and exceptions, you can ensure that you are getting the full
coverage you need from both insurance companies.


#### Subrogation And Reimbursement Subrogation And Reimbursement

When you have other health coverage, such as Medicare or another employer's health plan,
Northwind Standard may still provide coverage in certain circumstances. This is called
\"subrogation and reimbursement.\" Subrogation and reimbursement works when another
health plan pays for a service that is covered by Northwind Standard. In this case,
Northwind Standard will pay for the same service, assuming that it was medically necessary
and you received it from an in-network provider.

If Northwind Standard pays for a service that is already covered by your other health plan,
you may be responsible for reimbursing Northwind Standard. This can happen if you do not
provide Northwind Standard with proof of your other coverage.

There are certain exceptions to subrogation and reimbursement. If you are a Medicare
beneficiary, Northwind Standard will not seek reimbursement from Medicare. In addition,
Northwind Standard will not seek reimbursement from any other health plan if the service
you received is not covered by the other health plan.

Standard with proof of your other coverage. This can include a copy of your other plan's

<!-- PageBreak -->

Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or a letter from the other health plan stating that the service
is not covered.

allow Northwind Standard to determine if the service is covered and if you are eligible for
subrogation or reimbursement.

Finally, if you have any questions or need assistance with filing claims, Northwind Standard
offers a customer service team that can help. You can contact them at any time, and they can
provide you with the information you need to understand your coverage and benefits.

By understanding subrogation and reimbursement and the exceptions to it, you can ensure

HOW DO I FILE A CLAIM?

Timely Filing
HOW DO I FILE A CLAIM?

Timely Filing

At Northwind Health, timely filing is important to ensure that your claims are processed
correctly and in a timely manner. All claims must be filed within twelve months of the date
of service, otherwise the claims may be denied. Claims submitted after the twelve month
window may be reviewed for consideration of payment, however, no guarantee is made that
the claims will be accepted.

If you are a Northwind Standard member, you may be able to file a claim directly through
the Northwind website or app. If you're filing a claim on behalf of a family member, make
sure that you have their authorization to do so.

It's important to also keep in mind that some services are subject to pre-approval from
Northwind Health, and your provider may need to submit a request prior to the service
being performed. This includes services such as MRI/CT scans, physical therapy, and other
specialty services. If you are unsure whether your provider requires pre-approval for a
service, you should contact Northwind Health prior to the service being performed.

There are a few exceptions to the twelve month timely filing limit. These include claims
submitted for newborns, claims submitted for a deceased member, and claims submitted for

<!-- PageBreak -->

services that were provided out-of-country. In these situations, claims may be submitted up
to 24 months after the date of service.

It's also important to remember that when filing a claim, you should make sure to include
all necessary documentation. This includes itemized bills, a completed claim form, and any
other documentation that is requested by Northwind Health. If any of these items are
missing, your claim may be delayed or denied.

To ensure timely filing, it's important to keep track of the dates of service for all services
you receive. You should also keep copies of all documentation related to your services, and
if you're unsure of the filing requirements, you should contact Northwind Health for
clarification.

guidelines for timely filing and including all necessary documentation with your claims, you

What You Can Appeal
COMPLAINTS AND APPEALS

What You Can Appeal

When you have Northwind Standard coverage, you have the right to appeal any denial of
services or payment of benefits. This includes if you disagree with the amount of the
payment or if you feel that your claim was denied incorrectly. You also have the right to
appeal if you feel that an authorization was not provided for a service, or if you believe that
a service should be covered by your plan but was not.

If you believe that your claim was wrongly denied or that you have a dispute over a service
that is covered or not covered, you have the right to file a formal appeal. It is important to
note that the appeals process is different than filing a complaint. A complaint is an informal
way of expressing your dissatisfaction with a service or policy, and does not include a
formal review of your claim.

You can file an appeal by submitting a letter or appeal form to Northwind Health. The letter
or form should include the reason for your appeal, supporting documentation, and any
other information that you believe will be relevant to your case. It is important to note that
you must file your appeal within 60 days of the date of the denial, or within 180 days if the
denial is related to a service that was preauthorized by your insurance provider.

When you file your appeal, Northwind Health will review it and provide you with a written
decision. This decision will include an explanation of why your claim was denied or why a
service was not covered. It is important to note that all appeals will be reviewed according
to the terms of your plan and in relation to any applicable state or federal laws.

<!-- PageBreak -->

If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your appeal, you may be able to pursue a second
level of appeal. You may also be able to file a complaint with your state insurance
department if you believe that your rights have been violated.

It is important to remember that Northwind Health must provide you with the specific
reason for your denial in writing, and must provide you with appeal rights in writing. The
appeal process may require you to submit additional information, so it is important to make
sure that you provide all relevant information. Additionally, you may also want to consider
consulting an attorney or other qualified professional if you believe that your rights have
been violated.

When filing an appeal, it is important to keep accurate records of all communication and
correspondence. This includes any letters or forms that you submit, as well as any
responses that you receive from Northwind Health. Additionally, you should consider
keeping copies of any medical records, documents, or other information that may be
relevant to your appeal. This will help to ensure that your appeal is handled properly and
that you receive a fair and timely response.

Overall, it is important to remember that you have the right to appeal any denied services or
payments under your Northwind Standard plan. This process can be complex, so it is
important to make sure that you understand your rights and the appeals process.
Additionally, if you are not satisfied with the outcome of your appeal, you may be able to
pursue a second level of appeal or file a complaint with your state insurance department.

under the plan, such as primary care physician visits, specialty care services, and other
healthcare services. Depending on the plan, these independent contractors may also
provide services such as mental health and substance abuse counseling, physical therapy,

coverage for care received from independent contractors. Employees must pay for these
services out-of-pocket, and any claims for services provided by independent contractors
must be submitted directly to the provider.

When seeking care from an independent contractor, it is important for employees to make
sure they are aware of any additional fees or restrictions that may apply. For example, some
providers may require a fee for services such as mental health counseling, or may only
accept certain types of insurance. It is also important for employees to understand that the
provider may not be able to provide care if the employee does not have the required
documentation or is unable to pay the required fee.

In addition, it is important for employees to understand that independent contractors may
not be subject to the same regulations as other healthcare providers. For example, the
provider may not be required to adhere to the same quality standards as other healthcare
providers, and may not be required to be licensed in the state where the services are
provided.

When selecting a provider, it is important for employees to make sure they are familiar with
the provider's policies and procedures. Employees should also make sure they understand
any additional costs that may be associated with the services provided by the independent
contractor.

Finally, when selecting a provider, it is important for employees to research the provider's
background and credentials. Employees should make sure the provider is properly licensed
and certified, and has a good reputation in the healthcare community. Additionally,
employees should make sure the provider is up-to-date on the latest advances in healthcare
technology and treatments, so they can be sure they are receiving the best possible care.

Overall, when selecting a healthcare provider, it is important for employees to do their
research and make sure they understand the provider's policies and procedures, as well as
any additional costs that may be associated with the services they provide. Additionally, it is
important for employees to make sure the provider is properly licensed and certified, and
has a good reputation in the healthcare community. By doing their research and
understanding the provider's qualifications and policies, employees can be sure they are
receiving the best possible care.

determine if the providers and services offered are sufficient for the employee's needs.

In addition, Northwind Health may make claims that their plan offers low or no cost
prescription drugs. While Northwind Standard does offer a prescription drug coverage, it is
important to remember that the plan does not necessarily offer low or no cost prescription
drugs. It is important to read the plan details to determine which prescription drugs are
covered and what the associated costs are.

Finally, Northwind Health may make claims that their plan is the best plan available. While
Northwind Standard may be a good plan, it is important to remember that there may be
other plans that are better suited to the employee's needs. It is important to research other
plans and compare them to Northwind Standard in order to determine which plan is the
best option.

time and money.

This right of recovery means that if the insured has already paid for a service that is covered

<!-- PageBreak -->

already paid for a service that is covered under the plan and are unaware that they can be
reimbursed.

However, there are certain conditions that must be met in order for the right of recovery to

the plan's effective date, before the employee was enrolled in the Northwind Standard plan.
Additionally, the service must be one that is covered under the plan. If the service is not
covered, then the employee will not be eligible for the right of recovery.

It is important for employees to keep in mind that the right of recovery must be requested
within two years of the service being provided in order for the employee to be eligible for
reimbursement. Any claims submitted after this period will not be considered.

In addition, there are some services that are not eligible for the right of recovery. These
include services related to mental health and substance abuse, emergency services,
inpatient services, and any services that are not covered under the Northwind Standard
plan.

It is also important to note that the right of recovery is only applicable to services that were
paid for by the insured, and not by any other third party. This includes family members,
friends, employers, or other insurance plans.

Employees should keep in mind that the right of recovery is subject to the terms and
conditions of the Northwind Standard plan. Therefore, it is important to read the plan
documents in detail to understand any additional exclusions or limitations of the right of
recovery.

To take advantage of the right of recovery, employees should submit a claim to the

### Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998

OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PLAN: Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998

The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 (WHCRA) is a federal law that provides
rights and protections to people receiving mastectomies, a surgery to remove all or part of
the breast. Under this law, health plans, including Northwind Standard, must provide
coverage for mastectomies, reconstructive surgery, and other related medical services that
are required by the attending physician in connection with a mastectomy.

The WHCRA applies to all group health plans, including Northwind Standard, and health
insurance issuers that offer group health plans. This law requires all group health plans,
such as Northwind Standard, to provide coverage for reconstructive surgery and other
related medical services when it is medically necessary to reconstruct the breast or to treat
physical complications of the mastectomy.

<!-- PageBreak -->

Not all mastectomies will qualify for WHCRA coverage. For example, mastectomies that are
done for cosmetic reasons or for the treatment of a non-invasive breast cancer (i.e. Ductal
Carcinoma in situ) are not covered under WHCRA.

In order for the coverage to be effective, the attending physician must provide written
certification that the mastectomy was medically necessary. The certification should include
a description of the medical condition, the type of mastectomy performed, and the type of
reconstructive surgery required. The attending physician must also certify that the
mastectomy was performed for medical reasons and not for reasons of cosmetic
enhancement.

When the attending physician provides the written certification, the plan must provide
coverage for the mastectomy and any reconstructive surgery that is required. The coverage
must include all stages of reconstruction, prostheses, and other supplies related to the
reconstruction. The plan must also provide coverage for physical complications of the
mastectomy, including lymphedema, which is a condition that causes swelling due to a
buildup of lymph fluid in the affected area.

In addition, the plan must provide coverage for outpatient services, such as physical therapy
and counseling, that are related to the mastectomy or reconstructive surgery. The plan must
also provide coverage for ancillary services that are related to the mastectomy or
reconstructive surgery, such as ambulance services, durable medical equipment, and
prosthetic devices.

Under the WHCRA, the coverage must be provided without imposing any additional costs or
restrictions on the patient. This means that the patient should not have to pay any
additional coinsurance, copayment, or deductible for the mastectomy or reconstructive
surgery.

The WHCRA also provides rights for women who have already had mastectomies. If a
woman has already had a mastectomy and the plan does not cover reconstructive surgery
or medically related services, the plan must provide coverage for those services if the
attending physician certifies that the services are medically necessary.

Finally, the WHCRA provides certain rights for women who are considering having a
mastectomy. In particular, the law requires that all group health plans provide a written
notice to women about the coverage that is available under the plan for mastectomies and
reconstructive surgery. This notice must be provided at the time of enrollment in the plan
and at least annually thereafter.

The WHCRA provides important rights and protections to women who have had, or are
considering having, a mastectomy. It is important for employees to understand their rights
and to make sure that their health plan is providing the coverage that is required by the law.
