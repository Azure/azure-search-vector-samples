## HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS


### In-Network Providers HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS

Choosing the right provider is an important part of getting the most value out of your health
insurance plan. With Northwind Health Plus, you have access to an extensive network of in-
network providers. Working with these providers is an essential part of getting the most
value out of your plan.

In-Network Providers

When choosing an in-network provider for your health care needs, make sure to check with
Northwind Health Plus to ensure that the provider is in-network. This is important because
in-network providers charge lower rates than out-of-network providers. Northwind Health
Plus offers a wide range of in-network providers, including primary care physicians,
specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This lets you choose a provider that is most
convenient for you and your family.

It is important to note that in-network providers may not always be available in every area.
The Northwind Health Plus website offers a searchable directory of all in-network
providers in your area. This directory is regularly updated, so you can be sure that you are
choosing from in-network providers that are available in your area.

Cost Savings

Using an in-network provider can help you save money on health care services. In-network
providers have agreed to charge lower rates for their services, which can help you save
money on your out-of-pocket costs. In addition, Northwind Health Plus may offer additional
discounts or cost-savings for using in-network providers.

Emergency Services

<!-- PageBreak -->

In the event of an emergency, you can receive care from both in-network and out-of-
network providers. However, if you choose to receive care from an out-of-network
provider, your out-of-pocket costs may be higher. Therefore, it is important to consider the
cost of out-of-network care when deciding whether to seek emergency care.

Tips for Choosing an In-Network Provider

When choosing an in-network provider, there are a few tips to keep in mind:

· Check with Northwind Health Plus to make sure that the provider you are considering is
in-network.

that can help you save money on health care services. By following the tips outlined above,
you can make sure that you are choosing an in-network provider that is most convenient
and cost-effective for you and your family.


#### Continuity of Care

HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Continuity of Care

It's important to understand continuity of care when selecting a provider. Continuity of care
is the process of being treated by the same provider or medical team over a period of time.
When you have continuity of care, your provider has a better understanding of your medical
history, enabling them to provide more accurate diagnoses and treatments.

Continuity of care is important when selecting a provider because it ensures better quality
of care. When you have continuity of care, your provider is more familiar with your medical
history, which can lead to more effective treatments. Also, if you stay with the same
provider for a period of time, the provider will be more likely to know about any changes in
your health and can offer more personalized care.

<!-- PageBreak -->

The Northwind Health Plus plan offers coverage for continuity of care. This means that if
you have been seeing the same provider for a period of time, you may be able to continue
seeing them without having to switch to a different provider in the network.

However, it's important to note that there are some exceptions to the continuity of care rule.
If you are switching to a new provider, you may be required to switch to an in-network
provider. Additionally, if you are switching from an in-network provider to an out-of-
network provider, you may be required to switch to an in-network provider.

When selecting a provider, it's important to keep continuity of care in mind. Here are a few
tips that can help you ensure continuity of care:

· Always check your provider's network status before scheduling an appointment.

· If you're switching to a new provider, make sure they are in-network.

· Ask your provider if they offer continuity of care.

. If you are switching to a new provider, make sure they are familiar with your medical
history.

· If you are switching from an in-network provider to an out-of-network provider, make
sure you understand what that means for your coverage.

· Make sure you keep all of your medical records up to date.

Continuity of care is an important factor to consider when selecting a provider. Northwind
Health Plus offers coverage for continuity of care, so you may be able to continue seeing the
same provider without having to switch to a different provider in the network. However,
there are some exceptions to the continuity of care rule, so it's important to understand
what those are. By following these tips, you can ensure you have the best possible coverage
and ensure continuity of care.

Non-Participating
HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS

When it comes to health care, the provider you choose can have a major impact on your
costs. With Northwind Health Plus, you have the option to choose from a variety of in-
network providers. However, if you choose to go outside of the network, you may incur
additional costs.


#### Non-Participating Providers

Non-participating providers are providers that are not in-network with Northwind Health
Plus. When you visit a provider that is not in-network, you will be responsible for the entire
cost of the care. This means that, if you choose to visit a provider who is not in-network, you
will have to pay the entire cost of the service out-of-pocket.

<!-- PageBreak -->


#### Exceptions

There are some exceptions to this rule. If you are traveling outside of the United States and
you cannot find an in-network provider, you may be able to visit a non-participating
provider and Northwind Health Plus may cover a portion of the cost. Additionally, if you are
in a life-threatening situation and need to go to the nearest hospital, Northwind Health Plus
may provide coverage for the care received.

Tips

If you are considering visiting a provider that is not in-network, it is important to check
with Northwind Health Plus first. Before your visit, contact the customer service line to find
out if the provider is in-network and if there are any exceptions that could apply to your
situation. Additionally, it is important to review your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) after
your visit to ensure that you are not being charged for any services that were not covered
by your insurance. If you are charged for a service that was not covered, contact Northwind
Health Plus right away.

If you are considering a new provider, it is important to ask if they are in-network with
Northwind Health Plus. This can save you time and money in the long run. Additionally, you
can use Northwind Health Plus's online provider directory to search for a provider that is
in-network and view their ratings.

By understanding the difference between in-network and non-participating providers and
being aware of any exceptions that may apply to you, you can save money on your health
care costs. Northwind Health Plus is here to help you make the most of your coverage. If you
have any additional questions about in-network and non-participating providers, please
contact the Northwind Health Plus customer service line.

Balance Billing Protection

HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Balance Billing Protection

Balance billing is a practice where a provider bills you for the difference between the
allowed amount and billed amount. The allowed amount is the amount that your insurance
company determines is a reasonable fee for a service. The amount you are billed for is the
amount that the provider charges you for the services. With Northwind Health Plus, you are
protected from balance billing. This means that you can rest assured that you will not be
billed more than the allowed amount by your provider.

Balance billing protection is an important part of Northwind Health Plus. This protection
ensures that you will not be responsible for the difference between the allowed amount and
the billed amount. This protection helps you to avoid unexpected costs.

Exceptions:

<!-- PageBreak -->

Balance billing protection does not apply to out-of-network providers. If you receive
services from an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for the difference
between the allowed amount and the billed amount.

Balance billing protection also does not apply to certain services, such as cosmetic services
and experimental procedures. If you are considering receiving any of these services, it is
important to check with Northwind Health Plus to determine whether balance billing
protection applies.

Tips:

1\\. Get preauthorization: When you are planning to receive a service, it is important to get
preauthorization. Preauthorization will help you to determine if the service is covered and
the amount that you will be responsible for.

2\\. Ask questions: Ask your provider questions about the services they are providing and the
cost of the services. This will help you to understand the costs associated with the services
and to determine if balance billing protection applies.

3\\. Use in-network providers: Whenever possible, use in-network providers. This will help
you to ensure that balance billing protection applies and that you do not receive unexpected
bills.

4\\. Consider alternative treatments: Consider whether there are any alternative treatments
or procedures that may be less expensive. This may help you to keep costs down and to
avoid balance billing.

5\\. Know your rights: Make sure that you are aware of your rights when it comes to balance
billing. Northwind Health Plus is responsible for informing you of your rights and for
providing you with balance billing protection.

By taking the time to understand balance billing protection and to familiarize yourself with
the tips above, you can help to ensure that you are not responsible for unexpected bills.
Balance billing protection is an important part of Northwind Health Plus and it is important
to take the time to understand how it works.


##### Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted Providers

HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted
Providers

Northwind Health Plus offers coverage for out-of-network or non-contracted providers;
however, it is not as comprehensive as the coverage provided for in-network services.
When you seek care from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay more for
services than you would if you had used an in-network option.

When seeking care from an out-of-network provider, it is important to know exactly what
services are covered and what you will be expected to pay out of pocket. Generally, out-of-

<!-- PageBreak -->

network providers are not required to accept the same reimbursement rates as contracted
providers, so the cost of care could be significantly higher.

It is also important to know that services received from an out-of-network provider may not
count towards your deductible or be applied to your out-of-pocket maximum. This means
that you may be responsible for paying the entire cost of the services, minus any applicable
discounts. It is important to keep in mind that you may also be subject to balance billing
from an out-of-network provider. Balance billing occurs when the provider bills you for the
difference between their billed charges and the amount paid by Northwind Health Plus.

In some cases, you may be able to receive care from an out-of-network provider if there is
not an in-network option available. In these cases, Northwind Health Plus will cover the
same amount as if the care was provided by an in-network provider.

When considering care from an out-of-network provider, it is important to understand the
potential risks of doing so. You may end up paying more out of pocket because the provider
is not contracted with Northwind Health Plus, or you may be subject to balance billing.

It is important to do your research before seeking care from an out-of-network provider.
Make sure to ask questions about the provider's billing policies, cost of services, and any
potential discounts. It is also important to call Northwind Health Plus prior to receiving care
to make sure that the services are covered and to understand your financial responsibility.

Tips for seeking out-of-network care:

· Ask the provider if they accept Northwind Health Plus and if they will accept the amount
paid by the plan.

· Ask the provider what their billing policies are and if they offer any discounts.

. Ask Northwind Health Plus if the services are covered and if there are any limits or
exclusions.

· Ask Northwind Health Plus if you will be subject to balance billing.

. Check to see if there is an in-network provider available that offers the same services.

By taking the time to understand the differences between in-network and out-of-network
care and by doing your research, you can make sure that you are making the best decisions
for your health and your wallet.

HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS

When it comes to healthcare, one of the most important decisions you can make is choosing
the right provider. With Northwind Health Plus, you can select from a wide range of in-
network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and
pharmacies. This plan also covers emergency services, both in-network and out-of-network.

<!-- PageBreak -->

The provider you choose will have a direct impact on your costs. When you use in-network
providers, you'll pay lower out-of-pocket costs. On the other hand, if you use out-of-network
providers, you'll be responsible for a larger portion of the cost. In some cases, you may be
responsible for the entire cost.

It is important to note that in-network providers are not necessarily the same across all
plans. So, even if a provider is in-network for one plan, they may not be in-network for
another. Therefore, it's important to check if your preferred provider is in-network before
you select a plan.

When selecting a provider, there are a few tips you should keep in mind:

· Research your provider's credentials. Make sure they are properly licensed and
accredited.

· Ask about their experience. How long have they been in practice? What kind of patients
have they treated in the past?

· Ask about their methods. Do they use evidence-based treatments? Are they up-to-date on
the latest medical advancements?

· Ask about their services. Do they offer preventive care services? What about mental health
and substance abuse services?

· Ask about their costs. Do they offer payment plans or discounts? How do they compare to
other providers in terms of cost?

· Ask about their availability. Are they available to answer questions or provide guidance
when needed?

· Check reviews. Read reviews from past patients to get a better idea of their experience.

By taking the time to research your provider, you can ensure that you're getting the best
care possible at the lowest cost.

There are also a few exceptions to be aware of. For example, Northwind Health Plus does
not cover elective or cosmetic procedures. Additionally, some services are only covered
when they are performed by in-network providers. So, make sure to check the plan's
provider network before scheduling any services.

Finally, if you have any questions or need help selecting a provider, you can always contact
Northwind Health's customer service team. They can provide you with helpful information
and advice about selecting the right provider for your needs.

By following these tips and doing your research, you can make sure you're getting the best
care possible at the lowest cost. With Northwind Health Plus, you can rest assured that
you're getting quality coverage for all your healthcare needs.

## IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION


### Copayments (Copays) IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Copayments (Copays)

When using Northwind Health Plus, you may be responsible for a copayment (or copay) for
certain services. A copayment is a fixed amount that you are expected to pay for a service.
The amount of the copayment varies based on the type of service received, whether the
service is rendered by an in-network or out-of-network provider, and other factors.


#### In-Network Copays:

For in-network services, copayments are generally lower than for out-of-network services.
The copayment for primary care visits is typically around $20, while specialist visits have a
copayment of around $50. For in-network emergency services, the copayment is typically
around $100. In addition, for in-network preventive care services, there is typically no
copayment.

Out-of-Network Copays:

For out-of-network services, copayments are typically higher than for in-network services.
The copayment for primary care visits is typically around $50, while specialist visits have a
copayment of around $75. For out-of-network emergency services, the copayment is
typically around $150. Please note that Northwind Health Plus will only cover a portion of
out-of-network services, and you may be responsible for the remaining balance.


#### Exceptions:

There are a few exceptions to the copayment amounts listed above. For example, for mental
health and substance abuse services, the copayment for in-network services is typically
around $30 and the copayment for out-of-network services is typically around $60. In
addition, the copayment for preventive care services is typically waived if received from an
in-network provider.

Tips:

It is important to remember that copayments are subject to change and may vary depending
on the type of service received. It is also important to note that copayments are not waived
for out-of-network services, and you may be responsible for the remaining balance after
Northwind Health Plus has paid its portion.

Finally, it is important to make sure that the provider you are seeing is in-network. This can
be easily done by checking the provider directory on the Northwind Health Plus website. It
is also important to remember that if you receive a service from an out-of-network
provider, you may be responsible for a higher copayment.

<!-- PageBreak -->

By understanding and following these tips, you can be sure to get the most out of your
Northwind Health Plus coverage and avoid unnecessary copayments.


### Split Copay For Office Visits IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Split Copay For Office Visits

Northwind Health Plus offers a split copay for office visits in order to make healthcare more
affordable for its members. This means that you will pay a lower copay for office visits than
you would for other services. The split copay is applied to office visits with primary care
physicians, specialists, and mental health providers.

Office visits with primary care physicians are subject to a $35 copay. Office visits with
specialists are subject to a $60 copay. Mental health visits with a psychiatrist or another
mental health provider are subject to a $45 copay.

There are a few exceptions to this split copay. Emergency room visits and urgent care visits
are not subject to the split copay and will be subject to the full copay amount that applies to
the type of provider that you visited. Office visits with an anesthesiologist are also not
subject to the split copay and will be subject to the full copay amount that applies to the
type of provider that you visited.

When visiting your doctor, it is important to understand which type of provider you are
visiting. Knowing whether you are visiting a primary care physician, specialist, or mental
health provider will help you to understand how much your copay will be. Your copay
amount will be listed on your insurance card.

When you visit a doctor, you should also inform the office staff that you are a Northwind
Health Plus member. This will ensure that the staff bills your insurance correctly and that
you are charged the correct amount for your copay.

If you have any questions about your copay amount, you can contact Northwind Health's
customer service team. They will be able to provide more detailed information about your
coverage and copay amount.

It is important to remember that the split copay only applies to office visits. Other services,
such as lab tests, X-rays, and imaging tests, are subject to different copay amounts, which
are listed on your insurance card.

It is also important to remember that the split copay only applies to in-network providers. If
you visit an out-of-network provider, you will be subject to a higher copay amount, which is
also listed on your insurance card.

At Northwind Health Plus, we are committed to helping our members get the care they need
at a price they can afford. With the split copay for office visits, we hope to make healthcare
more affordable for you and your family.

#### Calendar Year Deductible


### IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Calendar Year Deductible

The Northwind Health Plus plan has a calendar year deductible that applies to some
services. The amount you must pay out-of-pocket before the plan begins to pay for covered
services is called the calendar year deductible. The calendar year deductible is the same for
all members of the plan and is reset each year on the plan's renewal date.

For In-Network Services: The calendar year deductible for in-network services is $1,500 for
individuals and $3,000 for families. This means that you must pay the full cost of all covered
services until you have paid a total of $1,500 for an individual and $3,000 for a family. Once
this amount is reached, the plan will begin to pay its share of the cost of eligible services.

For Out-of-Network Services: The plan does not have a calendar year deductible for out-of-
network services. However, out-of-network services are subject to higher cost sharing than
in-network services, so be sure to check with your provider to find out the cost sharing that
applies.

Exceptions: Certain services are exempt from the calendar year deductible. These services
include preventive care services and emergency services.

Tips:

· Be sure to check with your provider to find out if a service is subject to the calendar
year deductible before receiving the service.

· Make sure you understand the cost sharing that applies to out-of-network services.

· Be aware that the calendar year deductible is reset each year on the plan's renewal
date.

· Remember that preventive care services and emergency services are exempt from
the calendar year deductible.


#### Coinsurance

IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance

Coinsurance is a cost-sharing requirement under Northwind Health Plus. This means that
after you have met your deductible, you will be responsible for a certain percentage of the
costs for covered services. The coinsurance rate is usually a percentage of the allowed
amount for a service, and it is your responsibility to pay this amount.

For example, if the allowed amount for a service is $100 and your coinsurance is 20%, you
are responsible for paying $20 (20% of $100). The insurance company will pay the
remaining amount of $80.

<!-- PageBreak -->

Coinsurance may apply to all services, including hospitalization, emergency room visits,
preventive care, and some mental health and substance abuse services. However,
coinsurance does not apply to some services, such as preventive care services.

It is important to understand the amount of coinsurance you are responsible for. Depending
on the type of service, your coinsurance could be a percentage of the allowed amount or a
fixed amount. This information should be provided to you in your plan documents.

When you receive care, you will receive a bill that outlines the cost of the service and the
amount you are responsible for paying. If you have met all of your deductibles and
coinsurance requirements, the plan will pay the remaining costs.

Tips for Using Your Coinsurance:

1\\. Review your plan documents to understand the coinsurance rates for all services you
may need. This will help you budget for any services you may need in the future and be
better prepared for the cost.

2\\. Consider using in-network providers when possible. Many plans offer lower coinsurance
rates for in-network providers, meaning you will pay less for the same service.

3\\. Ask your provider for an estimate of the cost of a service before you receive it. This will
help you determine how much of the cost you will be responsible for.

4\\. Keep track of the services you receive and the amount you pay. This will help you
understand how much you have paid towards your coinsurance requirement for the year.

5\\. Contact your plan administrator if you have any questions about your coinsurance
requirement or what services are subject to coinsurance.


#### Out-Of-Pocket Maximum

IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Out-Of-Pocket Maximum

Under the Northwind Health Plus plan, members are responsible for costs associated with
their health care. These costs can include deductibles, copays, coinsurance, and other out of
pocket expenses. To help members manage health care costs, the Northwind Health Plus
plan offers a maximum out-of-pocket (OOP) limit. Once a member has reached the OOP
limit, they pay no more out-of-pocket costs for the rest of the plan year.

Understanding the Out-of-Pocket Maximum

The Northwind Health Plus plan's out-of-pocket maximum includes deductibles, copays,
coinsurance, and other out-of-pocket expenses. This amount does not include premiums,
balance-billed charges, or charges for non-covered services. The OOP maximum resets at
the start of each plan year, meaning members have to start from scratch when the new plan
year begins.

<!-- PageBreak -->

The OOP maximum applies to all services, including in-network and out-of-network
services, except for non-covered services, balance-billed charges, and premium payments.
This means that all in-network services and out-of-network services count towards the OOP
maximum.


### Exceptions

There are a few exceptions to the OOP maximum. For example, if a member seeks services
from a provider that is not in-network, they may be balance-billed for the difference
between what the provider charges and what Northwind Health Plus allows. Balance-billed
charges do not count towards the OOP maximum.

Another exception is non-covered services. If a member receives a service that is not
covered by the plan, they may be responsible for paying the full cost of the service. These
services also do not count towards the OOP maximum.

Tips for Reaching the Out-of-Pocket Maximum

Reaching the OOP maximum can be a challenge, but there are a few tips that can help
members get there.

First, it's important to understand what services are covered by the plan and which are not.
Northwind Health Plus covers a wide range of services, including preventive care, primary
care, and specialty care. It's important to know which services are covered and which are
not so members can make the most of their coverage.

Second, it's important to stay in-network as much as possible. Staying in-network helps
members get the most out of their coverage and saves them money. In-network providers
typically charge lower rates and provide a higher level of care than out-of-network
providers.

Third, it's important to understand the difference between deductibles, copays, and
coinsurance. Deductibles are the amount a member has to pay before the plan starts paying,
copays are a set fee for services, and coinsurance is the percentage of the cost a member has
to pay. Understanding these three terms can help members make more informed decisions
about their care.

Finally, it's important to take advantage of preventive care services. Preventive care
services are covered at 100% by Northwind Health Plus and can help members stay healthy
and avoid costly treatments and services down the road.

Reaching the out-of-pocket maximum can be a challenge, but with the right knowledge and
tips, members can take advantage of their Northwind Health Plus plan and get the most out
of their coverage.

Allowed Amount

IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Allowed Amount

<!-- PageBreak -->

When receiving services under Northwind Health Plus, you are responsible for paying a
portion of the cost of care. The portion of the cost that you are required to pay is known as
the Allowed Amount. The Allowed Amount is the amount that the plan will pay towards the
cost of care. The Allowed Amount may vary depending on the type of care received.

For example, if you receive services from an in-network provider, the Allowed Amount may
be lower than if you receive services from an out-of-network provider. The Allowed Amount
also may vary depending on the type of service received. In general, preventive services
such as physicals, immunizations, and screenings have lower Allowed Amounts than other
types of care.

You should always check with the provider prior to receiving services to determine the
Allowed Amount that Northwind Health Plus will pay for the services you are receiving.
This way, you will know what your financial responsibility will be and can plan accordingly.

When you receive services from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay
the full Allowed Amount up front. You then can submit a claim to Northwind Health Plus for
reimbursement of the Allowed Amount less any applicable copays, coinsurance, or
deductibles.

In some cases, Northwind Health Plus may not cover services that are considered
experimental or investigational. If a service is not covered, you may be responsible for the
entire cost of the service. Therefore, it is important to check with Northwind Health Plus
prior to receiving services to determine if a service is covered.

In addition, some services may be subject to pre-authorization or pre-certification. This
means that you must obtain approval from Northwind Health Plus prior to receiving the
service. If pre-authorization or pre-certification is not obtained, you may be responsible for
the full cost of the services.

It is important to understand that the Allowed Amount does not include any applicable
copays, coinsurance, or deductibles that may be due. It is also important to understand that
the Allowed Amount may vary depending on the type of care received and the type of
provider that is providing the care. Therefore, it is important to check with the provider
prior to receiving services to determine the Allowed Amount that Northwind Health Plus
will pay for the services you are receiving.

Finally, it is important to keep track of your out-of-pocket expenses. This includes any
copays, coinsurance, or deductibles that you may be required to pay. It is important to
understand what your financial responsibility is when receiving care under Northwind
Health Plus, so that you can plan accordingly and make sure that you are meeting your
financial obligations.

## COVERED SERVICES

COVERED SERVICES: Acupuncture

Acupuncture is an ancient form of healing that has been practiced in China for thousands of
years. It involves the use of very thin needles inserted into specific points in the body to
stimulate energy flow and promote physical and emotional balance. Northwind Health Plus
covers acupuncture services, including both in-network and out-of-network acupuncture
providers.

When using an in-network acupuncture provider, coverage is provided for up to 12 visits
per year. Each visit must be medically necessary and approved by your primary care
physician. All acupuncture services must be performed by an appropriately licensed
acupuncturest, and acupuncture services are limited to one hour per visit.

<!-- PageBreak -->

When using an out-of-network acupuncture provider, Northwind Health Plus covers up to
$25 per visit, after the deductible has been met. Out-of-network acupuncture services must
also be medically necessary and approved by your primary care physician. All acupuncture
services must be performed by an appropriately licensed acupuncturest and services are
limited to one hour per visit.

When you visit an acupuncture provider, be sure to bring your Northwind Health Plus
insurance card and a form of payment for the office visit or copayment. You will also need to
provide the acupuncture provider with the authorization from your primary care physician.

Before scheduling an acupuncture appointment, it's important to make sure the
acupuncturest is licensed and in-network with Northwind Health Plus. It's also important to
talk to your primary care physician to make sure that acupuncture is an appropriate
treatment for your medical condition.

In addition to traditional acupuncture treatments, Northwind Health Plus also covers
acupuncture-related services such as acupressure, cupping, moxibustion, and tui na. These
services may be covered when provided by an appropriate acupuncturest as part of a
treatment plan approved by your primary care physician.

cosmetic purposes. Services for nutritional counseling, massage therapy, and physical
therapy are also not covered. Northwind Health Plus also does not cover acupuncture

Allergy Testing and Treatment
COVERED SERVICES: Allergy Testing and Treatment

At Contoso, we understand that allergies can be a major source of discomfort and
inconvenience for our employees. That's why we are proud to offer coverage for allergy
testing and treatment through Northwind Health Plus. Allergy testing and treatment
services are covered under the plan, with some exceptions.

Allergy Testing

If your physician determines that allergy testing is medically necessary, Northwind Health
Plus will cover the cost of the testing. This includes skin tests, blood tests, patch tests, and
other diagnostic tests that your doctor may order.

Allergy Treatment

Once your doctor has determined the cause of your allergies, Northwind Health Plus will
cover the cost of treatment. This includes medications such as antihistamines, nasal sprays,

<!-- PageBreak -->

and inhalers. In addition, Northwind Health Plus will cover the cost of immunotherapy,
which is a long-term treatment that helps to reduce the severity of your allergies.


### Exceptions

In some cases, Northwind Health Plus may not cover all of the costs associated with allergy
testing and treatment. These exceptions include the following:

· Allergy medications that are available over-the-counter.

· Allergy shots that are not prescribed by a doctor.

### Ambulance

COVERED SERVICES: Ambulance

Ambulance services are covered under Northwind Health Plus. This includes any
transportation to and from medical facilities, as long as it is medically necessary. In most
cases, ambulance services are covered when no other form of transportation is available.

If you need to use an ambulance, it must be one that is in your network and has been
approved by Northwind Health. You will be responsible for paying any applicable
coinsurance and copays for this service. If you use an out-of-network ambulance, you may
be responsible for the entire cost of the service.

<!-- PageBreak -->

When deciding whether you need an ambulance, you should consider your medical
condition and the available transportation options. If you are able to use a car or another
form of transportation, this will usually be the most cost-effective option. However, if you
require medical assistance during transportation, an ambulance may be necessary.

It is important to remember that ambulance services are only covered if they are medically
necessary. If you are unsure of whether a service is medically necessary, you should speak
to your primary care physician or a Northwind Health representative.

If you have an emergency medical condition and require ambulance services, you should
call 911. In this case, you will not be responsible for any out-of-pocket expenses, as
emergency services are covered under Northwind Health Plus.

In addition to emergency services, Northwind Health Plus also covers non-emergency
ambulance services. These services are typically used when non-emergency transportation
is needed to and from a medical facility. If you require non-emergency transportation, you
should speak to your primary care physician who can determine if the service is medically
necessary.

If your primary care physician determines that ambulance services are medically necessary,
you should contact your local ambulance provider. You should provide them with your
Northwind Health Plus plan information and Northwind Health will cover the cost of the
service, minus any applicable coinsurance and copays.

In conclusion, Northwind Health Plus covers ambulance services when they are medically
necessary. This includes emergency services and non-emergency services. If you need to
use an ambulance, it must be one that is in your network and has been approved by
Northwind Health. You should always contact your primary care physician to determine if a
service is medically necessary before using an ambulance, as this will help you to avoid any
out-of-pocket costs.

Cellular Immunotherapy And Gene Therapy
Cellular Immunotherapy and Gene Therapy

Cellular Immunotherapy and gene therapy are two of the newest treatments available in the
medical world, and are covered under Northwind Health Plus.

Cellular Immunotherapy is a type of treatment that boosts a patient's own immune system
to fight off diseases and illnesses. This type of treatment is done through the use of a
patient's white blood cells, which are extracted and modified to be able to recognize and
attack cancer cells. These modified white blood cells are then reintroduced into the patient's
body, allowing their immune system to fight the cancer. This type of therapy is typically
used to treat cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, as well as some other types of cancer.

<!-- PageBreak -->

Gene therapy is a therapeutic modality that involves the introduction of exogenous genetic
material into an individual's cells for the purpose of modifying or correcting pathological
gene expression patterns. This process can be accomplished through various vectors,
including viral and non-viral delivery systems, with the aim of inducing therapeutic effects
through the modulation of cellular processes.

Both of these treatments are covered under the Northwind Health Plus plan, but there are
some exceptions. For example, treatments that are experimental in nature are not covered.
Additionally, treatments that are deemed to be not medically necessary or not
recommended by a physician are also not covered.

When considering cellular immunotherapy or gene therapy, it is important to discuss the
risks and benefits with your doctor. It is also important to make sure that the treatment is
covered by your insurance, and to review any pre-authorization requirements that may be
necessary for the treatment. Additionally, it is important to be aware of any potential side
effects that may occur from these treatments, and to make sure that you are comfortable
with the potential risks and benefits of the treatment.

Northwind Health Plus covers Orthognathic Surgery, also referred to as Jaw Augmentation
or Reduction, as a covered service. This procedure is used to correct irregularities in the jaw
and face caused by misalignment of bones or teeth. It is a complex procedure that involves
cutting and repositioning the jaw bones to improve the alignment and overall appearance of
the face.

cases, you may need to be referred to a specialist for a more in-depth evaluation.

In some cases, Northwind Health Plus may require pre-authorization for Orthognathic
Surgery prior to the procedure being performed. This means that you may need to get
approval from Northwind Health Plus before the procedure can be done. Your physician can
provide you with more information about this process.

After the procedure, your physician may recommend that you wear a protective appliance,
such as a splint or headgear, to protect your jaw while it heals. You may also need to attend
follow-up appointments with your physician to monitor your progress.

Northwind Health Plus typically covers the cost of Orthognathic Surgery, but you should
confirm with your provider that all costs associated with the procedure are covered.
Additionally, you should keep in mind that there may be certain limitations or exclusions

manipulation is a form of manual therapy that is used to treat musculoskeletal conditions. It
is often used to treat back pain, neck pain, and headaches. Other manipulations may be used
to treat conditions such as shoulder pain, hip pain, and knee pain.

Spinal manipulations can be performed by a variety of healthcare providers, including

manual force to joints of the spine, hips, and other areas of the body. The goal is to reduce
pain and improve mobility.

The Northwind Health Plus Plan covers the cost of spinal manipulations up to a certain
amount each year. In addition to covering the cost of the manipulation itself, the plan also
covers the cost of x-rays and other tests that may be necessary to diagnose the condition
being treated. This plan also covers the cost of any supplies or equipment needed to
perform the manipulation.

However, the Northwind Health Plus Plan does not cover the cost of spinal manipulations
performed for cosmetic reasons. It also does not cover the cost of long-term care or
maintenance manipulations.

When considering spinal manipulation as a treatment option, it is important to discuss the
potential risks and benefits with your doctor. Your doctor can help you determine if this
form of therapy is right for you and can provide you with information on the potential side
effects.

In addition, it is important to make sure that you are working with a qualified practitioner.
Check with your insurance company to make sure that the practitioner you are considering
is in-network and covered by your plan. Also, make sure that the practitioner is experienced
and knowledgeable in the type of manipulation that they are performing.

Finally, keep in mind that spinal manipulations are not a substitute for medical care. If you
are experiencing severe pain or other symptoms, you should seek medical attention
immediately.

you can make sure that you are making an informed decision about your health care. With

services and get the treatment you need.

risks associated with surgery. It is important to discuss any potential risks with your doctor
before undergoing a surgical procedure. It is also important to understand what is involved
in the recovery process, so that you can plan accordingly.

<!-- PageBreak -->

Finally, it is important to take the necessary steps to ensure that the surgery is successful.

put you at risk for complications, and getting the proper follow-up care. It is also important
to understand how to manage any pain or discomfort that may occur after the surgery.

progressive muscle relaxation can help reduce jaw tension and relieve TMJ symptoms.

Therapeutic Injections
COVERED SERVICES: Therapeutic Injections

At Northwind Health, we understand the importance of having access to therapeutic
injections that can help treat medical conditions and provide relief from pain. We are
pleased to offer coverage for therapeutic injections as part of the Northwind Health Plus
plan.

Therapeutic injections are a type of procedure in which drugs or other substances are
injected directly into the body to treat medical conditions and provide relief from pain. The
most common types of therapeutic injections are corticosteroids, which reduce
inflammation, and hyaluronic acid, which can be used to treat joint pain.

Therapeutic injections are often used to treat a range of conditions, such as arthritis,
tendonitis, bursitis, and muscle spasms. They can also be used to treat chronic pain and can
help reduce inflammation and swelling. Therapeutic injections can also be used to provide
relief from migraines, headaches, and other types of pain.

Under the Northwind Health Plus plan, therapeutic injections are covered when they are
administered by a licensed healthcare professional. These injections must be medically
necessary and prescribed by a physician in order to be eligible for coverage.

In some cases, members may be required to obtain prior authorization before receiving a
therapeutic injection. This prior authorization ensures that the injection is medically
necessary and that it is the most appropriate treatment for the condition.

The Northwind Health Plus plan does not cover experimental or investigational treatments,
including injections that are not medically necessary. Members should also be aware that
not all therapeutic injections are covered under the plan.

<!-- PageBreak -->

It is important to note that therapeutic injections can have side effects and risks, so
members should always discuss these with their healthcare provider before undergoing the
procedure. Members should also discuss any potential costs that may not be covered under
the plan, such as the cost of the drug or any additional procedures that may be necessary.

When using therapeutic injections, it is important to follow up with your healthcare
provider to ensure the injection was effective and that there are no complications.
Additionally, members should always follow the instructions provided by their healthcare
provider and ensure that the injection is administered properly.

By taking advantage of the therapeutic injections covered under the Northwind Health Plus
plan, members can benefit from improved health and pain relief without additional costs.
Members should always discuss their options with their healthcare provider and be sure to
follow the instructions provided in order to ensure the best outcome.

Transplant coverage includes both the transplant itself, as well as associated costs such as
pre- and post-transplant care, hospital stays, medications, and laboratory services. Pre-
transplant testing and evaluation, including laboratory services, imaging tests, and other

associated with the procedure. Additionally, there may be out-of-pocket costs for services
that are not covered under Northwind Health Plus.

only available to individuals who are healthy enough to tolerate the procedure and the
associated recovery time. Additionally, most transplants require the individual to comply
with certain medical protocols to ensure the best chance of success. For example, some
transplants require the individual to undergo certain laboratory tests or to take certain
medications prior to the procedure.

<!-- PageBreak -->

It's also important to be aware of the potential risks associated with transplants. Potential
risks include infection, organ rejection, and other issues related to the body's response to
the procedure. It's important to discuss the potential risks with your doctor prior to
undergoing the procedure.

Finally, it's important to be aware that the availability of transplants is limited. Transplants

rays, if they are not covered by your plan. Your in-network urgent care provider should be
able to tell you what your costs will be before you receive any services.

are the same. Here are some tips to help you make the best decision for your situation:

<!-- PageBreak -->

you plan to visit.

throughout the United States. These providers are part of Northwind Health Plus'
nationwide network, which is designed to ensure that you are able to receive care, no
matter where you are.

Out-of-area care is coverage that extends outside of Washington. This means that if you

However, there are some exceptions to this coverage. For example, you may be limited to a
certain number of visits or treatments that are covered outside of Washington. Additionally,
certain services may not be covered, such as home health care services that are provided

## CARE MANAGEMENT


### Prior-Authorization

CARE MANAGEMENT: Prior Authorization

Under Northwind Health Plus, there is a care management system that includes prior
authorization. Prior authorization is a process that requires approval from Northwind
Health Plus for certain services and medications before they are covered. Prior
authorization is intended to ensure that members receive medically necessary, safe, and
cost-effective healthcare services.

Prior authorization is required for some outpatient services, such as outpatient surgery,
some imaging studies and physical therapy, as well as for some medications. Prior
authorization is also required for some inpatient services and procedures. Northwind
Health Plus may also require prior authorization for other services or medications.

For services and medications that require prior authorization, you must contact Northwind
Health Plus before receiving the service or medication to determine if prior authorization is
required. If so, you will need to obtain prior authorization through the Northwind Health
Plus prior authorization process.


### Exceptions

There are some exceptions to the prior authorization requirement. Certain preventive
services, such as annual physicals and routine check-ups do not require prior authorization.
In some cases, Northwind Health Plus may also waive the prior authorization requirement
for certain services and medications.

Tips for Employees

If you think you may need a service or medication that requires prior authorization, it is
important to plan ahead and contact Northwind Health Plus before receiving the service or
medication. This will help ensure that your service or medication is covered by Northwind
Health Plus.

If you receive a service or medication without prior authorization, you may be responsible
for the entire cost of the service or medication. You can also be billed for any services or
medications that are determined to be not medically necessary.

Prior authorization can take several days to complete, so it is important to plan ahead and
contact Northwind Health Plus as soon as possible. Northwind Health Plus may also require

<!-- PageBreak -->

additional information, such as medical records or lab results, in order to complete the prior
authorization process.

If you have any questions about prior authorization, it is important to contact Northwind
Health Plus for more information. Northwind Health Plus can provide you with information
about prior authorization and help you understand what services and medications require
prior authorization.

How Prior-Authorization Works
CARE MANAGEMENT: Prior-Authorization

Prior authorization (or pre-authorization) is an important part of the Northwind Health
Plus plan. Before certain services and treatments can be covered, they must first be

Prior-Authorization for Benefit Coverage

CARE MANAGEMENT: Prior-Authorization for Benefit Coverage

The Northwind Health Plus plan includes a care management system that requires prior-
authorization for certain services to ensure that the plan is covering only medically
necessary care. Prior-authorization is a process used by the insurance company to review a
request for a specific service to ensure that it is medically necessary and meets the criteria
set by the plan. This process helps to ensure that members are receiving the best care
possible and that their benefits are used in the most cost-effective manner.

In order to receive prior-authorization, members must provide their Northwind Health Plus
provider with the necessary clinical information regarding their diagnosis and treatment
plan. The provider then submits this information to Northwind Health Plus for review.
Northwind Health Plus will then contact the provider with the decision on the prior-
authorization request.

Prior-authorization is required for certain services, including but not limited to:

· Inpatient Hospitalizations

· Outpatient Surgery

· Durable Medical Equipment

· Certain Imaging Services

· Certain Lab Tests

· Certain Physical and Occupational Therapy Services

· Certain Prescription Drugs

. Certain Home Health Services

<!-- PageBreak -->

It is important to note that some services do not require prior-authorization, as they are
considered non-medically necessary. In addition, some services may only require prior-
authorization for certain members, such as those with high-risk conditions. The Northwind
Health Plus plan has a list of services that require prior-authorization, which is available on
the Northwind Health Plus website.

There are certain exceptions to prior-authorization requirements. For example, if a member
requires emergency services, prior-authorization is not required. In addition, certain
pediatric services are exempt from prior-authorization.

It is important for members to understand that prior-authorization does not guarantee
coverage. The prior-authorization process is used to determine if a service is medically
necessary and meets the criteria set by the plan. If a service is not medically necessary or
does not meet the criteria set by the plan, the service may be denied.

It is also important for members to understand that prior-authorization is not a guarantee
that the service will be provided in a timely manner. While Northwind Health Plus strives to
make decisions on prior-authorization requests as quickly as possible, the process can take
time.

Here are some tips for members to help ensure that prior-authorization requests are
processed in a timely manner:

· Ensure that all necessary information is provided to the provider when requesting prior-
authorization.

· Make sure that the provider submits the prior-authorization request as soon as possible.

· Contact the insurance company if you have not received a response after a reasonable
amount of time.

· Ensure that the provider is aware of any changes in the member's condition that may
affect the prior-authorization request.

Prior-authorization is an important part of the Northwind Health Plus care management
system. It helps ensure that members are receiving the best care possible and that their
benefits are used in the most cost-effective manner. By understanding prior-authorization
and following the tips outlined above, members can help ensure that their prior-
authorization requests are processed in a timely manner.

### Prior-Authorization For Out-Of-Network Provider Coverage

CARE MANAGEMENT: Prior Authorization For Out-Of-Network Provider Coverage

As an employee of Contoso, you may be eligible to receive coverage for care provided by
out-of-network providers. Northwind Health Plus offers coverage for out-of-network
providers, but the plan requires prior authorization. This means that you must obtain
approval from Northwind Health before seeing an out-of-network provider.

Prior authorization is a process in which Northwind Health reviews your request for
coverage and decides whether or not it will cover the care that you have requested. To be
approved for prior authorization, you must meet certain criteria and provide certain
information. This criteria and information may vary depending on the type of care you are
requesting.

Prior authorization requests must be submitted to Northwind Health by your provider. In
most cases, your provider will submit the request for you. Northwind Health will then
review the request and make a decision about whether or not it will cover the care.

<!-- PageBreak -->

In some cases, Northwind Health may approve the request for coverage, but with certain
limitations or conditions. For example, Northwind Health may limit the number of visits for
a specific procedure or limit the amount of coverage for a specific procedure. It is important
to understand any limitations or conditions that Northwind Health places on the prior
authorization before you receive care from an out-of-network provider.

It is also important to understand that certain services may not require prior authorization.

Plus for review and processing.

. Outpatient Mental Health Services: Services that are medically necessary and provided by

<!-- PageBreak -->

the services are covered by Northwind Health Plus and to check with Northwind Health
Plus to make sure that the services are covered.

It is also important to remember that out-of-network providers may charge more than
those in-network. Northwind Health Plus does not guarantee the amount charged by an out-
of-network provider, and the member is responsible for any balance remaining after the
plan has paid its portion.

services even if they are provided by an out-of-network provider. Prior authorization is a
process in which Northwind Health Plus reviews and evaluates the medical necessity of the
requested service. This process helps to ensure that the services being requested are
medically necessary and are provided in accordance with the plan's specific rules and
guidelines.

In conclusion, Northwind Health Plus makes exceptions to the prior authorization
requirement for certain services when they are provided by an out-of-network provider.

services provided by an out-of-network provider, that out-of-network providers may charge

exceptions and tips, employees can ensure that they are making responsible and informed
decisions about their healthcare needs.


### Clinical Review CARE MANAGEMENT - Clinical Review

Northwind Health Plus offers several care management services to ensure that members
are receiving the best possible care. One of the primary care management services is
Clinical Review. Clinical Review is an important process that helps to ensure that members
are receiving the most appropriate care and that their care is in line with established clinical
guidelines.

Clinical Review involves a team of healthcare professionals who review services,
treatments, and medications to ensure that they are medically necessary and appropriate
for the individual's condition. The review team may also look at other factors, such as cost
and effectiveness, to ensure that the care provided is in line with established standards.

Clinical Review is available for all care services covered by Northwind Health Plus. This
includes preventive care, primary care, specialty care, and hospital services. Clinical Review
is also available for services provided by out-of-network providers.

In some cases, Clinical Review may result in a denial of coverage for certain services and
medications. If a service or medication is denied, the provider will be notified and will have
the opportunity to appeal the decision. The appeal process is designed to ensure that
members receive the care that is medically necessary and appropriate for them.

There are a few exceptions to Clinical Review. In some cases, the review team may not be
able to review all of the information necessary to make an appropriate decision. In these
cases, the review team may be unable to make a decision and the provider may be able to
provide coverage for the service or medication without going through the review process.
Additionally, Clinical Review does not apply to services that are not covered by Northwind
Health Plus, such as cosmetic surgeries or experimental treatments.

It is important to remember that Clinical Review is an important component of quality care.
Northwind Health Plus is committed to ensuring that members receive the care that is
medically necessary and appropriate for them.

WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?

Coordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans
WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?

Coordinating Benefits With Other Health Care Plans

If you have other health care coverage, such as Medicare or a health plan from another
employer, you may be able to coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus. Coordinating
benefits means that both plans work together to pay for covered services. This coordination
helps to ensure that you don't pay more than you should for your health care.

When coordinating benefits, one plan pays first and the other plan pays what is left after the
first plan has paid. The plan that pays first is called the primary plan, and the plan that pays
second is called the secondary plan. Generally, the primary plan pays up to the amount of its
allowed amount for the services you received. The secondary plan then pays the difference
between what the primary plan paid and the total cost of the services.

The way in which you coordinate benefits will depend on the type of coverage you have.

Coordinating Benefits with Medicare

If you have Medicare, you may be able to coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus.
Medicare is a federal health insurance program for people 65 years of age and older, people
with certain disabilities, and people with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Northwind
Health Plus is a secondary payer to Medicare, meaning that Medicare will pay first and then
Northwind Health Plus will pay the remaining balance after Medicare has paid its portion.

If you have Medicare, you will need to use an in-network provider within the Northwind
Health Plus network to coordinate benefits with your Medicare coverage. Medicare will pay
first and then Northwind Health Plus will pay the remaining balance.

Coordinating Benefits with Other Employer Plans

If you are covered under a health plan from another employer, that plan is usually
considered the primary payer and Northwind Health Plus is considered the secondary
payer. Your other employer plan will pay first and then Northwind Health Plus will pay the
remaining balance after the other employer plan has paid its portion.

<!-- PageBreak -->

To coordinate benefits with your other employer plan, you must use an in-network provider
within the Northwind Health Plus network. You will need to provide your other employer
plan's information in order to coordinate benefits.


### Exceptions

There are a few exceptions to coordinating benefits with other health care plans. For
example, you cannot coordinate benefits with a health plan that is not a major medical plan.
Also, if you are enrolled in a health plan that is a high-deductible plan, you cannot
coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus until you have met the deductible.

Tips

If you have other health care coverage, here are a few tips to help you coordinate benefits
with Northwind Health Plus:

. Make sure you have your other health care plan's information handy when you use
Northwind Health Plus.

· Always use an in-network provider within the Northwind Health Plus network to ensure
that your benefits are coordinated correctly.

· Make sure you understand your plan's rules for coordinating benefits.

· Ask your doctor or other health care provider about the cost of services before you receive
them to make sure that you are not paying more than you should.

· Read your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) carefully to make sure that your benefits are
being coordinated correctly.

By understanding how to coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus and other health
care plans, you can make sure that you are getting the most out of your health care
coverage.

COB Definitions

WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?

The term \"Other Coverage\" is defined as any other insurance, health plan, or other coverage
which provides benefits and services for medical care that is also provided under the
Northwind Health Plus plan. This includes, but is not limited to, Medicare, TRICARE,
Medicaid, employer-sponsored plans, and government-sponsored plans.

When you have Other Coverage, Northwind Health Plus follows something called
\"Coordination of Benefits\" (COB). This means that Northwind Health Plus coordinates its
benefits with the Other Coverage in order to ensure that you receive the maximum amount
of benefits available to you. Northwind Health Plus will pay benefits only after the Other
Coverage pays its benefits.

<!-- PageBreak -->

To understand how COB works, it is important to understand the following terms:

· Primary Coverage: This is the coverage that pays benefits first.

· Secondary Coverage: This is the coverage that pays benefits after the Primary Coverage
has paid out its benefits.

· Crossover Claims: These are claims that are submitted to both the Primary Coverage and
the Secondary Coverage at the same time.

In order for Northwind Health Plus to serve as the Secondary Coverage, you must provide
us with a copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) that you receive from your Primary
Coverage. This will help us determine the benefits that are available to you under
Northwind Health Plus.

For Crossover Claims, you should submit the claim to both Northwind Health Plus and your
Primary Coverage. You must provide Northwind Health Plus with a copy of the EOB for the
Primary Coverage, as well as a copy of the claim that you submitted to your Primary
Coverage. This will allow us to determine the benefits that are available to you under
Northwind Health Plus.

It is important to note that Northwind Health Plus does not cover any expenses that are
considered to be the responsibility of the Primary Coverage. Additionally, Northwind Health
Plus does not cover any expenses that are outside of the scope of coverage of the plan.

Here are some tips to help you make the most of your Coordination of Benefits:

. Make sure that you provide Northwind Health Plus with a copy of the EOB from your
Primary Coverage in order to determine the benefits that are available to you.

· Submit Crossover Claims to both your Primary Coverage and Northwind Health Plus.

· Be aware of any expenses that are considered to be the responsibility of the Primary
Coverage.

· Be aware of any expenses that are outside of the scope of coverage of the plan.

By understanding how Coordination of Benefits works and following these tips, you can
maximize your Northwind Health Plus benefits.

COB's Effect On Benefits

WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE? - COB's Effect On Benefits

When you have more than one health insurance policy, the policies coordinate benefits
through a process called Coordination of Benefits (COB). Coordination of Benefits is a
process that helps to determine which plan pays first when there are multiple health plans

<!-- PageBreak -->

available. This process is important because it affects how much you will pay out-of-pocket
for care.

When Northwind Health Plus is the primary insurance (the plan that pays benefits first),
any other insurance you may have will become the secondary insurance and only pays
benefits if there are unpaid charges from the primary plan. However, if Northwind Health
Plus is the secondary plan, then it pays benefits after the primary plan has paid its share.

The amount Northwind Health Plus pays for a covered service depends on the coverage of
the primary plan and the total amount charged for the service. Northwind Health Plus may
pay up to the amount of the maximum allowable charge, which is the maximum amount the
plan pays for a service.

If you have more than one health insurance policy, you may need to provide proof of the
other coverage, such as an insurance card or a letter from the other insurer, to verify which
plan is primary and which is secondary.

When you receive care, you may need to provide both your Northwind Health Plus
insurance card and your other insurance card to the provider, so they can coordinate the
benefits correctly.

When you receive care, you may need to provide both your Northwind Health Plus
insurance card and your other insurance card to the provider, so they can coordinate the
benefits correctly. It is important to note that Northwind Health Plus does not coordinate
benefits with Medicare, Medicaid, or TRICARE programs.

When coordinating benefits, there are a few important exceptions to keep in mind. If you
are covered by a spouse's health plan, the primary plan is usually the plan that covers the
spouse and the secondary plan is usually the plan that covers you. Additionally, if you are
covered by more than one group plan, the primary plan is usually the plan of the employer
who has the most employees.

Following these tips can help you understand how COB works and how to get the most out
of your health coverage:

· Understand the coverage of all of your health plans so that you know which plan is
primary and which is secondary.

. Contact your health care providers and make sure they are aware of all of your coverage
and that they know how to coordinate benefits.

. Keep copies of your insurance cards, letters from insurers, and other documents that
explain your coverage.

· Contact Northwind Health Plus if you have any questions or need help understanding how
COB works.

By understanding your coverage and being aware of how COB works, you can ensure that
you are getting the most out of your health plan and that you are not paying more out of
pocket than you need to.


#### Subrogation And Reimbursement Subrogation and Reimbursement

Subrogation and reimbursement are two important concepts to understand when it comes
to Northwind Health Plus insurance. Subrogation is the process by which Northwind Health
Plus can seek reimbursement from another insurance company if you have secondary
medical coverage. In other words, if you have coverage through Northwind Health Plus and
another insurance provider, Northwind Health Plus may be able to recoup the costs of
medical services they paid for from the other insurance company.

Reimbursement works in the opposite way. It is the process by which Northwind Health
Plus can reimburse you for certain medical expenses that you paid for out-of-pocket. This is
beneficial if you received medical services that were not covered by Northwind Health Plus.

When it comes to subrogation and reimbursement, it is important to note that Northwind
Health Plus reserves the right to subrogate and reimburse any payments made for medical
services. This includes payments made directly by you and other insurance companies. In
the event that Northwind Health Plus is able to subrogate or reimburse payments, you will
be notified of this before any funds are exchanged.

When it comes to subrogation, it is important to remember that Northwind Health Plus will
only seek reimbursement from another insurer if your primary insurance coverage does not
cover the services that you received. This means that if your primary insurance covers the
services that you received, Northwind Health Plus will not seek reimbursement.

When it comes to reimbursement, there are certain exceptions to Northwind Health Plus's
policy. For example, Northwind Health Plus will not reimburse you for any medical services
that were covered by another insurance provider. Additionally, Northwind Health Plus will
not reimburse you for any medical services that you received from an out-of-network
provider, unless the service was deemed medically necessary and was not available from an
in-network provider.

Finally, it is important to remember that Northwind Health Plus may require that you
submit certain documentation in order to receive reimbursement. This documentation may
include itemized bills, proof of payment, and/or medical records.

In order to ensure that you are able to take full advantage of Northwind Health Plus's
subrogation and reimbursement policy, it is important to keep detailed records of all
medical services that you receive. This includes records of payments made by you, other
insurance companies, and Northwind Health Plus. Additionally, it is important to keep a
record of any documentation you submit to Northwind Health Plus to support your

<!-- PageBreak -->

reimbursement claim. Keeping these records will help to ensure that you receive the full
reimbursement that you are entitled to under the Northwind Health Plus policy.

Uninsured And Underinsured Motorist/Personal Injury Protection Coverage
WHAT IF I HAVE OTHER COVERAGE?

Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist/Personal Injury Protection Coverage

Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist (UM/UIM) coverage is an optional form of coverage
that may be included in Northwind Health Plus. This coverage will help protect you and
your passengers if you're injured in an accident caused by an uninsured or underinsured
driver.

If you have UM/UIM coverage, it will provide coverage for medical bills, lost wages, and
other expenses that you may incur as a result of an accident. However, it is important to
note that UM/UIM coverage only applies when the other driver is at fault, and does not
cover damage to your vehicle or property.

There are a few exceptions to the coverage provided by UM/UIM coverage. For example, it
does not cover intentional acts of another driver, damage caused by an uninsured or
underinsured driver in a hit-and-run accident, or damage to your vehicle or property.

It is important to understand the limits of your UM/UIM coverage and any exclusions that
may apply. You should make sure to review your policy thoroughly to ensure that you are
properly covered.

In addition to understanding the limits of your coverage, there are other tips that you can
use to help protect yourself in the event of an accident.

First, make sure that you have a valid driver's license and that the other driver does as well.
It's also important to make sure that the other driver has valid insurance coverage. You may
want to ask to see proof of insurance before you get in the car.

If you do get into an accident, it's important to stay calm and take down the other driver's
name, contact information, and insurance information. You should also call the police and
make sure to file a police report. This will help provide evidence of the accident and can be
used to pursue a claim with your insurance company.

Finally, if you do find yourself in an accident, make sure to contact your Northwind Health
Plus insurance provider as soon as possible to file a claim. Your insurance company will be
able to help you understand the limits of your coverage and provide you with the resources
you need to pursue a claim.

Having Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist/Personal Injury Protection Coverage through
Northwind Health Plus can provide you and your passengers with peace of mind in the
event of an accident. It's important to understand the limits of your coverage and any
exclusions that may apply. It's also important to stay vigilant and always make sure that the

<!-- PageBreak -->

other driver has valid insurance coverage. By following these tips, you can help protect
yourself and your passengers in the event of an accident.

Evidence of medical necessity is documentation that is provided by a healthcare provider or
other healthcare professionals to support a request for a specific service or treatment. This
documentation should provide detailed information about the patient's medical condition,
the recommended service or treatment, and why it is medically necessary.

Evidence of medical necessity is typically required when requesting services or treatments

The Group And You
OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PLAN

The Group and You

<!-- PageBreak -->

The Northwind Health Plus plan is a group health plan that is sponsored by Contoso and
administered by Northwind Health. As a participant in this group plan, you will have access
to a wide range of health benefits and services.

Your employer, Contoso, pays a portion of the premium for the plan, and you are
responsible for paying the remaining portion. This will be deducted directly from your
paycheck each month. In addition to the premium, you may be responsible for certain costs
when you receive health care services.

Your contributions to the plan are based on the type of coverage you choose. For example, if
you choose a single plan, you will pay a lower premium than if you choose a family plan. The
premium and other costs you may incur when you receive health care services may change
from year to year.

It is important to note that you may be subject to certain exclusions or limitations on your
coverage, such as pre-existing condition exclusions and/or waiting periods. You should

coverage you have from other sources.

Healthcare Providers - Independent Contractors
OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PLAN

Healthcare Providers - Independent Contractors

The Northwind Health Plus plan includes coverage for healthcare services provided by
independent contractors. This means that services provided by independent contractors
may be covered under the Northwind Health Plus plan, provided that the service is
medically necessary.

Independent contractors are healthcare providers that are not employed by Northwind
Health or any other company or organization. They are self-employed and provide services
on a contract basis. These services can include medical, vision, and dental services, as well
as prescription drug coverage and mental health and substance abuse coverage.

It is important to note that services provided by independent contractors are not covered
under the Northwind Health Plus plan unless they are necessary to treat an illness or injury.
For example, a physical therapist who is an independent contractor may be covered under
the plan if the services are necessary to treat an illness or injury. However, services
provided by an independent contractor that are not medically necessary, such as a massage
therapist or acupuncturest, are not covered under the plan.

When selecting a healthcare provider, it is important to make sure that the provider is an
independent contractor and is covered under the Northwind Health Plus plan. You can do
this by checking the provider's website or calling the provider's office to confirm that they
are an independent contractor and that their services are covered under the Northwind
Health Plus plan.

It is also important to note that any services that you receive from an independent
contractor may be subject to a deductible or coinsurance. This means that you may be
responsible for a portion of the cost of the service. It is important to check with the provider

not be able to recover the entire amount. In these cases, the insurance company may offer to
reimburse you for some portion of the money that you have already paid.

important to keep any receipts or other documentation. This documentation will be
necessary if you decide to file a Right of Recovery claim with the insurance company.
