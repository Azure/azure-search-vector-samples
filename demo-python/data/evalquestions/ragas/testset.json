            "providers, and the costs associated with each provider can vary significantly. To ensure \nyou\u2019re getting the best value for your health care services, it\u2019s important to understand how \nproviders can affect your costs.  \nIn-Network Providers  \nChoosing in -network providers is the most cost -effective option when it comes to your \nNorthwind Standard plan. In -network providers have agreed to accept a discounted rate on \nservices, which means they are often less expensive than out -of-network providers. When \nselecting an in -network provider, you will likely only have to pay a portion of the cost for \nservices, oft en referred to as a \u201cco -pay\u201d or \u201cco -insurance\u201d. It\u2019s important to note that \ndifferent types of services may require different co -pays or co -insurance, so it\u2019s best to \ncontact your provider to understand what the cost will be.  \nOut-of-Network Providers  \nNorthwind Standard offers coverage for some out -of-network providers, but the costs \nassociated with these providers can be significantly more expensive than in -network \nproviders. If you choose an out -of-network provider, you may be responsible for the entire \ncost of services, or a far greater portion of the cost than you would with an in -network \nprovider. In some cases, Northwind Standard may offer coverage for out -of-network \nproviders, but you may still have to pay more than you would for an in -network provid er.  \nExceptions  \nSome providers may offer services that are outside of the Northwind Standard plan \ncoverage. Depending on the services provided, you may have to pay out -of-pocket for \nservices that are not covered. Additionally, it\u2019s important to note that there may be different \nrules and coverage levels associated with certain types of services, such as those related to \nmental health and substance abuse.  \nTips  \nIf you\u2019re considering a provider that is not in -network, it\u2019s important to understand the \ncosts a ssociated with that provider before you book an appointment. Contacting the \nprovider directly to ask about their rates, as well as any special arrangements they offer for \nNorthwind Standard members, can help you get a better idea of what you\u2019ll be paying f or \nservices. Additionally, it\u2019s important to check with Northwind Health to make sure the \nprovider is covered by the Northwind Standard plan and what types of services are covered.  \nWhen selecting a provider, it\u2019s also important to consider the quality of care they provide. \nYou should look for providers that offer high -quality care that meets your specific needs. \nAdditionally, Northwind Health offers a variety of resources to help you find the right \nprovider, such as a provider search tool and a provider di rectory.  \nChoosing the right provider is important when it comes to your Northwind Standard plan. \nBy understanding how providers can affect your costs, you can make sure you\u2019re getting the "

This is called \n\u201csubrogation and reimbursement.\u201d Subrogation and reimbursement works when anothe r \nhealth plan pays for a service that is covered by Northwind Standard. In this case, \nNorthwind Standard will pay for the same service, assuming that it was medically necessary \nand you received it from an in -network provider.  \nIf Northwind Standard pays for  a service that is already covered by your other health plan, \nyou may be responsible for reimbursing Northwind Standard. This can happen if you do not \nprovide Northwind Standard with proof of your other coverage.  \nThere are certain exceptions to subrogation  and reimbursement. If you are a Medicare \nbeneficiary, Northwind Standard will not seek reimbursement from Medicare. In addition, \nNorthwind Standard will not seek reimbursement from any other health plan if the service \nyou received is not covered by the ot her health plan.  \nWhen filing claims, it is important to keep in mind that you need to provide Northwind \nStandard with proof of your other coverage.
