    "# Azure AI Search with Cohere Embed V3 Int8 Support\n",
    "This code demonstrates the use of the Cohere API to generate embeddings with the latest and highest-performing model from Cohere, [Cohere Embed V3](https://txt.cohere.com/introducing-embed-v3/). It also explains how to store these embeddings in Azure AI Search using the Python SDK as an Int8 vector data type. This approach maintains 100% of the embedding quality while reducing our index size by 4x compared to the Float32 representation.\n"
