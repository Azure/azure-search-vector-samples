    "# Azure AI Search integrated vectorization sample\n",
    "This code demonstrates how to use Azure AI Search as a vector store by automatically chunking and generating embeddings using the AzureOpenAIEmbedding skill as part of the skillset pipeline in Azure AI Search. \n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "To run the code, install the following packages. This sample currently uses version `11.4.0b12` which is a pre-release version. Please note, that integrated vectorization feature is in preview and has not been published to [azure-search-documents](https://pypi.org/project/azure-search-documents/#description) on pypi. If you'd like to use this feature, please reference the whl file. We hope to publish an updated version soon!"
