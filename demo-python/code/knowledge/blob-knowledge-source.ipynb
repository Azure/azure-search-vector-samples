This includes \\n\\nservices that are not covered under the plan, such as experimental treatments and services \\n\\nfor cosmetic purposes.  \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus also pays for emergency services, both in-network and out-of-\\n\\nnetwork. To be eligible for coverage, the emergency must meet certain criteria, as specified \\n\\nin the plan documents. If the emergency services do not meet the criteria, the member may \\n\\nbe responsible for the full cost of the services.  \\n\\nIn addition, Northwind Health Plus may pay for services that are not covered under the \\n\\nplan, if the health care provider determines that such services are medically necessary. The \\n\\nplan will pay for these services at the rates specified in the plan documents.  \\n\\nIt is important to note that all payments are subject to the terms and conditions of the plan, \\n\\nincluding any applicable copayments, coinsurance, and deductible amounts. Members \\n\\nshould always check with their health care provider to determine if a service is covered \\n\\nunder the plan and the amount that will be paid for the service.  \\n\\nIt is also important to note that Northwind Health Plus does not pay for any services that \\n\\nare not medically necessary. Any services that are deemed to be for cosmetic purposes, \\n\\nexperimental treatments, or not medically necessary will not be covered under the plan.  \\n\\nMembers should also keep in mind that the plan may not cover certain services if the \\n\\nmember has not met certain requirements, such as obtaining a referral from a primary care \\n\\nphysician or pre-authorization from Northwind Health Plus.  \\n\\nFinally, Northwind Health Plus may require pre-certification or pre-authorization for \\n\\ncertain services. It is the responsibility of the member to ensure that pre-certification or \\n\\npre-authorization is obtained prior to receiving services.\"\n",

      "        \"snippet\": \"Although Northwind Health Plus provides comprehensive coverage for medical, vision, and \\n\\ndental services, there are certain services and treatments that are excluded from the plan. It \\n\\nis important to understand these exclusions so that you can plan your care accordingly.  \\n\\nServices Not Covered:  \\n\\nNorthwind Health Plus does not cover services that are not medically necessary, such as \\n\\ncosmetic surgery or elective procedures. Additionally, services or treatments that are \\n\\nexperimental or investigational are not covered under this plan.  \\n\\nPrescriptions Not Covered: The plan does not cover prescriptions that are not medically \\n\\nnecessary, certain over-the-counter medications, or prescription medications that are used \\n\\nto enhance performance in athletics.  \\n\\nMental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment: The plan does not cover mental health or \\n\\nsubstance abuse treatment services provided by a non-network provider or any services \\n\\nthat are not medically necessary. \\n\\nPreventive Care: Northwind Health Plus does not cover preventive care services provided \\n\\nby a non-network provider.  \\n\\nTips for Avoiding Exclusions \\n\\nWhen considering a medical service or treatment, it is important to review the plan's \\n\\nevidence of coverage to ensure that the service or treatment is covered under the plan. You \\n\\nshould also discuss the service or treatment with your doctor to ensure that it is medically \\n\\nnecessary. Additionally, you should review the list of excluded services and prescriptions to \\n\\nensure that you are not seeking treatment for an excluded service or prescription.  \\n\\nIf you are considering a medical service or treatment that is not covered under the plan, you \\n\\nshould discuss payment options with your doctor or healthcare provider. Additionally, you \\n\\nmay need to consider other payment sources, such as private insurance, flexible spending \\n\\naccounts, or state or federal programs.\"\n",
