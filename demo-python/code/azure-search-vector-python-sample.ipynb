    "Use this notebook to generate text embeddings using Azure OpenAI, insert those embeddings into a vector store in Azure AI Search, and perform a wide variety of vector search queries, including vector searches with metadata filtering and hybrid (text + vectors) search. The code uses Azure OpenAI to generate embeddings for title and content fields. You'll need access to Azure OpenAI to run this demo.\n",
