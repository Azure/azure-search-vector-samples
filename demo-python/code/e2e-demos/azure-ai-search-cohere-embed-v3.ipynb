    "# Azure AI Search with Cohere Embed V3 Int8 and Binary Embeddings Support\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll demonstrate how to leverage `Cohere Embed V3` to generate int8 and binary embeddings, significantly reducing memory costs while maintaining high search quality. We'll integrate these embeddings with Azure AI Search and perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using CommandR+ in Azure AI Studio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: int8 embeddings reduce memory usage by 4x, while binary embeddings offer a 32x reduction.\n",
    "- **Cost Reduction**: Lower memory requirements lead to substantial cost savings.\n",
    "- **Speed**: Faster search performance, up to 30% speed-up with int8 and 40x faster with binary embeddings.\n",
    "- **Quality**: Maintain 99.99% of original search quality with int8 and up to 98% with binary embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
